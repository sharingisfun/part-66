Eventually he gave them a plan of the best quality that he could draw, but refused to pay them to read it. And so started his journeyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThroughout life, Ian has always tried to help people and assist them to fight against the tyranny that was being imposed upon them, at many times suffering reprisals because of this.\n\nMore and more and licenses are imposed upon us all. Many of these can avoided.\n\nIan has taken the Department of Natural Resources and Mines to the Land Court and won! A book was written on that topic called High Treason 5, Who Owns the Water.\n\nThings are getting harder and probably soon will be hard enough that people will start to take notice.\n\nPerhaps by reading these books some will begin to do the necessary, lawful things to correct our country: if we all as Australians stand and unite things will happen!\n\nAs this is my first attempt at creating and uploading a torrent please go easy on my faults! LOL.\n\nAll comments are welcome good and bad. I hope the web post works... Ian's web site is:\n\nIts only small but I would like some honest feedback on the site as well...\n\n\nThank you for your time and patience.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6af4dfe2bec000023998a17782a22d3fe20d551","amp;dn":"The+Cumulative+works+of+Ian+McLeod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6af4dfe2bec000023998a17782a22d3fe20d551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,175,77,254,43,236,0,0,35,153,138,23,120,42,34,211,254,32,213,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
