He and his friend Nonoha find a mysterious &quot;unsolvable puzzle&quot; near their school. The puzzle turns out to be a life-threatening &quot;philosopher's puzzle&quot; created by the mysterious group P.O.G. (Puzzle Of God)Orginization. After successfully solving the puzzle, Kaito is designated as a Solver and is joined by other Solvers as they battle P.O.G. all over the world by solving the &quot;philosopher's puzzles&quot;. The fate of the world is in the balance and kaito must conquer all of the challenges to save it with the help of his genius friends.\n\nThis is a comedy/adventure anime. It never feels too serious but it is entertaining to watch. The subs are not done by me and I think 24 of the 25 files are from SUBDESU, while episode 9 is from a group called WHYNOT. \n\nAll episodes have been named and catagorized for easy sorting and the second season is underway. Please enjoy this upload. Favorite me to look at all of my other uploads.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a2fec85b530bc0390b48962ed6447dbf52f3545","amp;dn":"Phi-Brain+S1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a2fec85b530bc0390b48962ed6447dbf52f3545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,47,236,133,181,48,188,3,144,180,137,98,237,100,71,219,245,47,53,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
