In America alone, he had nine number one singles and seven number one albums during the first 12 years of his solo career. Although he sold records, McCartney never attained much critical respect, especially when compared to his former partner, John Lennon. Then again, he pursued a different path than Lennon, deciding early on that he wanted to be in a rock band. Little more than a year after the Beatles' breakup, McCartney had formed Wings with his wife, Linda, and the group remained active for the next ten years, racking up a string of hit albums, singles, and tours in the meantime. By the late '70s, many critics were taking potshots at McCartney's effortlessly melodic songcraft, but that didn't stop the public from buying his records. His sales didn't slow considerably until the late '80s, and he retaliated with his first full-scale tour since the '70s, which was a considerable success. During the '90s, McCartney recorded less frequently, concentrating on projects like his first classical recording, a techno album, and the Beatles' Anthology.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nLog:\t\t\tYes\nLabel:                  Hear Music\nCatalog:                HRM-33600-25\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\n02.Home (When Shadows Fall)\n03.It's Only A Paper Moon\n04.More I Cannot Wish You\n05.The Glory Of Love\n06.We Three (My Echo, My Shadow And Me)\n07.Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive\n08.My Valentine\n09.Always\n10.My Very Good Friend The Milkman\n11.Bye Bye Blackbird\n12.Get Yourself Another Fool\n13.The Inch Worm\n14.Only Our Hearts\n15.Baby's Request\n16.My One And Only Love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecdc417ac927f92905450c61c04939810f886ad6","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+-+Kisses+On+The+Bottom+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecdc417ac927f92905450c61c04939810f886ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,220,65,122,201,39,249,41,5,69,12,97,192,73,57,129,15,136,106,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
