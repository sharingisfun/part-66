The series was based on a list of the top 100 National Football League players of all time, as compiled by a &quot;blue-ribbon&quot; panel assembled by the NFL Network. The members of the panel were current and former NFL coaches, players, executives, and members of the media. Each episode, broadcast each Thursday from September 3 to November 4, 2010, introduced a group of 10 players from the list, starting with the players ranked 100 through 91, and moving up the list each week.[1]\n\nThe final episode, premiering on November 4, 2010, introduced the top 10 players of all time according to the panel.[2] Jerry Rice was chosen as the top player of all time, with Jim Brown as the second choice.[3] The highest ranked defensive player, Lawrence Taylor, was ranked third.
