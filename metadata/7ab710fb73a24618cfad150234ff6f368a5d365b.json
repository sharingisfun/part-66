Episode 12 finished as the pinnacle of the series in most people's view. This episode is more of an anticlimax that fails to answer many questions and add new questions to ponder, but with no second season to answer any of the loose ends, one is left with an overall feeling of disappointment. This last episode matches the others in video and audio quality. It unfortunately does not satisfy our thirst for the real end of the story begun in Episode 1 and climaxed so well in Episode 12.\n\nCombine this with my other Season 1 torrent and you have the entire Series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab710fb73a24618cfad150234ff6f368a5d365b","amp;dn":"Rubicon+++%282010+-+Final+Episode+-+13%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab710fb73a24618cfad150234ff6f368a5d365b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,183,16,251,115,162,70,24,207,173,21,2,52,255,111,54,138,93,54,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
