Now it is notable for having an interesting cast and for being a great time capsule of the pop scene in London, England 1960. All the more curious in todays hindsight when that pop scene will witness a total transformation in the near future thanks to groups like The Beatles. Lovely Anne Aubrey had a brief career in the movies, 1957 to 1961 for some reason.\n\nDirected by Ken Hughes                                               \nProduced by Albert R.
