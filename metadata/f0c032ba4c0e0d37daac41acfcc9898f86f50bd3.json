This release 2004 on the Japanese 'PJL Records' label.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow: \nArt Pepper mostly sticks to standards on this Discovery LP, but he brings out new life in the veteran songs, particularly on such ballads as &quot;Round Midnight,&quot; &quot;What's New&quot; and &quot;Besame Mucho.&quot; With the assistance of pianist Russ Freeman, bassist Bob Magnusson and drummer Frank Butler, the great altoist (who is heard just prior to signing an exclusive contract with the Galaxy label) is also in top form on such pieces as &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;I'll Remember April.&quot; An excellent (if not quite essential) release.\n\n01. Among Friends   \n02. Round About Midnight  \n03. I'm Getting Sentimental Over You   \n04. Blue Bossa    \n05. What Is This Thing Called Love   \n06. What's New   \n07. Besame Mucho   \n08.
