New Mexico Territory. A stranger (Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don\\'t welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It\\'s a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he\\'s been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force. \n\n\n\nDirected By:- Jon Favreau\n\nWritten By:-  Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof \n\n\nStars:-      Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce9a918b3e5e05301c47d62646d25ef0fb0cc6a","amp;dn":"Cowboys+%26amp%3B+Aliens++2011+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce9a918b3e5e05301c47d62646d25ef0fb0cc6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,233,169,24,179,229,224,83,1,196,125,98,100,109,37,239,15,176,204,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
