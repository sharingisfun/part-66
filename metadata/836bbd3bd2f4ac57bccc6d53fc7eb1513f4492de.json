Experience your music collection like never before with this intense music driven arcade shooter. Each of your songs will have its own unique ebb and flow based on the music. Power up your spaceship and watch as the music boosts your firepower. \n\n\nRequirements:\n\nOS: OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.\nProcessor: Intel\nMemory: 512 MB RAM\nHard Disk Space: 250mb HD space \n\n\nPersonal message:\n\nI recommend turning the intensity to max and not play for over an hour at a time. I played for 2 hours and felt like my eyes were going to fall out and my head was going to explode. \n\nI am unsure if the multiplayer works because i have not tried it yet but single player should be enough for anyone because of the intensity.\n\nGood luck.\n\nSEED!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:836bbd3bd2f4ac57bccc6d53fc7eb1513f4492de","amp;dn":"Beat+Hazard+Ultra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"836bbd3bd2f4ac57bccc6d53fc7eb1513f4492de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,107,189,59,210,244,172,87,188,204,109,83,252,126,177,81,63,68,146,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
