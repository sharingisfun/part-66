As the stalwarts of Fairy Tail battle the sinister Phantom Lord Guild, the viewer learns that Lucy belongs to the fabulously wealthy and powerful Heartfilia family. But she's rejected her cold and mercenary father for the warm loyalty of her friends. Natsu goes one-on-one with Jaleel the Iron Dragon, and the viewer gets a hint of the scale of his latent power; Gray inadvertently wins the heart of water wizard Juvia (&quot;drip, drip, drop&quot;). The loyalty Lucy declared in the fight with the Phantom Lord wizards is severely tested when she discovers the shady background of guild lothario Loke, and brings his sad story to a satisfactory conclusion. The series takes a darker turn when Natsu, Gray, Lucy, and Juvia learn about Erza's unhappy childhood in a sinister tale that pits the Guild members against their most deadly foe to date: Jellal, the servant of Zeref, a god who is the embodiment of hatred. But even in dire situations, the filmmakers leaven the threats with a healthy dose of slapstick: Natsu fights two of Jellal's minions with his head stuck in a kawaii (ultra-cute) cat mask. In short, these adventures and misadventures deliver everything the rapidly growing cadre of fans expect from Fairy Tail.
