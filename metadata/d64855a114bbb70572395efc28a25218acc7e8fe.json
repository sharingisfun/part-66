Once again centered around Broken Social Scene singer/songwriter Jason Collett, Zeus bring to mind a mix of the Beatles meet the Band-style folk-rock. To these ends, we get the blues-rock leadoff cut &quot;Are You Gonna Waste My Time?,&quot; the T. Rex meet ELO number &quot;Anything You Want Dear,&quot; the epic Band-style ballad &quot;Hello, Tender Love,&quot; the rustic midtempo singalong &quot;Proud and Beautiful,&quot; and the languidly moving George Harrison moment &quot;Cool Blue.&quot; Ultimately, Busting Visions is a sprawling yet thoughtfully constructed album full of backwoods, sandals, and sunburn rock with enough slippery electric guitar work, backing vocals, chiming bells, plinky pianos, and various freaky percussion bits to qualify as a kind of modern-day hippie noodle-rock opus.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64855a114bbb70572395efc28a25218acc7e8fe","amp;dn":"Zeus+-+2012+-+Busting+Visions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64855a114bbb70572395efc28a25218acc7e8fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,72,85,161,20,187,183,5,114,57,94,252,40,162,82,24,172,199,232,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
