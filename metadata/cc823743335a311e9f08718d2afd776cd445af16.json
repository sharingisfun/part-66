Co-hosts Erica Johnson and Tom Harrington report on shocking claims and shoddy services that drive Canadians crazy. It's an hour of television that will have the country shouting, &quot;You're Busted!&quot; at their TV sets.\n\nAnti-viral tissue claims, bank fees, outrageous markups at a national car service chain, cable and phone service charges, fast-food marketing spin, extended warranty fine print -- even charities and government watchdogs get &quot;busted&quot; by Marketplace in this wide-ranging exposÃƒÂ©.\n\nAbout The Show:\nMarketplace is Canada's consumer watchdog Ã¢â‚¬â€ we've got your back. Now in its 39th year, Marketplace continues to be the CBC's highest-rated television current affairs series. Whether it is a slick scam, misleading marketing claim, a product that could put your health at risk, or maddening customer service, Marketplace weeds out wrongdoing against Canadians, and puts pressure on people in power to set things right. \n\n\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name:  marketplace.s39e12.the.busted.edition.hdtv.xvid-cldd.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 1 140 Kbps\nLength            : 419 MiB for 51mn 24s 915ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 998 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc823743335a311e9f08718d2afd776cd445af16","amp;dn":"marketplace.s39e12.the.busted.edition.hdtv.xvid-cldd.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc823743335a311e9f08718d2afd776cd445af16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,130,55,67,51,90,49,30,159,8,113,141,42,253,119,108,212,69,175,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
