Scott) and his son Chris go out camping overnight. In the morning, Dan wakes to find Chris delirious and convulsing. Meanwhile, the military convene an emergency team to announce there was an accident and that a deadly chemical used in warfare was accidentally released in the air over the Logan campsite. Father and son are admitted to hospital as the military starts issuing official denials on television. When Chris dies and Logan finds the military have been keeping the truth from him, he breaks out of quarantine. Buying guns and dynamite, Logan then embarks on a one-man justice squad, demanding the truth be told and determined to take revenge against those responsible.\n\nMovie: AVI\n\nVideo:\n\nResolution: 852X480 (16/9)\nFPS: 29.971\nBitRate: 3901 Kbps\nQuality Factor: 0.33 b/px\nCodec: Intel ITU H.264\n\nAudio:\n\nNumber of channels: 2\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\nBitRate: 256 Kbps\nCodec: MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9545014edb138721cc1812eef19fb79d01edd3","amp;dn":"Rage+%281972%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9545014edb138721cc1812eef19fb79d01edd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,149,69,1,78,219,19,135,33,204,24,18,238,241,159,183,157,1,237,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
