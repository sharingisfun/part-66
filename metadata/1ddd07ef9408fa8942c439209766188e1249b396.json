The police take the cash and dump him in the infamous El Pueblito prison Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a hell on earth where the prison gangs run the show. Driver has no ID or fingerprints but he still gets a visit from a corrupt American Embassy official who has heard about the money. If Driver doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a way of paying him off while heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inside, then heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to let the authorities know where Driver is. And it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be long before the guys he stole the money from find him too. Driver knows this is a sink-or-swim situation. He hooks up with a young boy who shows him how to survive in the prison, but the kid has a terrible secret. He shares a rare blood type with Javi Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the criminal who ruthlessly controls the prison and everyone in it. The kid is JaviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life insurance policy and he has doctors on standby to transplant his liver whenever the time comes. But Driver has other ideas and pretty soon he devises an audacious plan to escape with the kid, the kidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother and the money.\n\nGenre: Action | Drama\nIMDB rating: 8.4/10 from 1,189 users\nDirected by: Adrian Grunberg\nStarring: Mel Gibson, Peter Stormare and Dean Norris\n\nRelease Name: Get.The.Gringo.2012.HDTV-SER\nSize: 1.37GB\nVideo: XviD, 704Ãƒâ€”384, 1769.53 kbit/s, 23.9760 fps\nAudio: English, AC3, 255kbps\nRuntime: 1h 35m 59s\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ddd07ef9408fa8942c439209766188e1249b396","amp;dn":"Get+The+Gringo+2012+HDTV-SER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ddd07ef9408fa8942c439209766188e1249b396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,221,7,239,148,8,250,137,66,196,57,32,151,102,24,142,18,73,179,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
