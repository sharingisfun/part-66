Our twelve new cooking teams each take turns to transform an ordinary home into an instant restaurant, serving up a three- course menu designed to impress not only their fellow contestants but MKR judges, Pete Evans and Manu Feildel.\nTonight, it is Tasmania's turn as Megan and Andy battle to produce the eleventh (fifth of the second group) dinner of the series. How will they fare?\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:008c8d6abc682c9a77a393923f63c048a5b064ee","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.AU.S03E11.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"008c8d6abc682c9a77a393923f63c048a5b064ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,140,141,106,188,104,44,154,119,163,147,146,63,99,192,72,165,176,100,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
