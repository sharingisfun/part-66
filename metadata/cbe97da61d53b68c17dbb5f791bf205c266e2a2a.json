Take him to a remote warehouse. Hurt him a little. Scare him a lot. Keep your hands clean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hire a detective for the dirty work. Simple? ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no such thing as simple. The detective reveals he also has the wife tied up elsewhere in the warehouse. He thinks itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best interests to confront her as well. The husband goes along with the plan and the sight of his wife tied to a chair, her head covered with a bag, makes him feel suitably strong and powerful.However this is no simpering prey. The only thing this woman is unwilling to do is be a victim, or lose.\n\nGenre: Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 3.1/10\nDirected by: John Langridge\nStarring: Martin Compston, Craig Conway and George Morris\n\nRelease Name: Four.2011.BDRiP.XViD-TASTE\nSize: 700MB\nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”272, 989 kbps\nAudio: English, MP3, 160 kbps\nRuntime: 1h 24m 47s\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbe97da61d53b68c17dbb5f791bf205c266e2a2a","amp;dn":"Four+2011+BDRiP+XViD-TASTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbe97da61d53b68c17dbb5f791bf205c266e2a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,233,125,166,29,83,182,140,23,219,181,247,145,191,32,92,38,110,42,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
