The film focuses on Laura, who, second by second, intends to leave a house which hides an obscure secret, unharmed. Laura and her father Wilson settle down in a cottage they have to renew since its owner will soon put the house up for sale. They will spend the night there and repair the following morning. Everything seems to go smoothly until Laura hears a sound that comes from outside and gets louder and louder on the upper floor of the house. Wilson goes up to see what is going on while she remains downstairs on her own, waiting for her father to come down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f743dfa28dffa049441290b57e1b2ec66fb7b7b0","amp;dn":"The+Silent+House+%282010%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f743dfa28dffa049441290b57e1b2ec66fb7b7b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,67,223,162,141,255,160,73,68,18,144,181,126,27,46,198,111,183,183,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
