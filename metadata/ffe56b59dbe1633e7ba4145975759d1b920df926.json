But on the Broncos' second play, quarterback Craig Morton threw a 74-yard touchdown to wide receiver Haven Moses.\n\nThe score remained 7-3 until the third period. The Broncos recovered a fumble at the Oakland 17-yard line and then advanced the ball to the 2-yard line. On the next play, running back Rob Lytle was hit in mid-air by Raiders safety Jack Tatum, and lost the ball. Oakland nose tackle Mike McCoy picked up the loose ball and began returning it for an easy touchdown, but the play was prematurely blown dead by an official on the opposite side of the field. The officials ruled that Lytle was stopped before the fumble, even though replays clearly showed the ball was knocked free at the moment of contact. With no instant replay challenge rules available to Oakland at the time, Denver retained possession. The Raiders were then penalized half the distance to the goal for arguing the call, and Jon Keyworth scored a Denver touchdown on the next play to give Denver a commanding 14-3 lead. The officials made another erroneous call in the game, replays showed, in favor of Oakland when they ruled an acrobatic touchdown catch by Broncos wide receiver Jack Dolbin as incomplete.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dave Casper, cutting the Broncos' lead to 14-10. However, linebacker Bob Swenson intercepted Stabler on Oakland's next drive, and three plays later, Moses caught a 12-yard touchdown pass. With 3:16 left in the game, Casper scored on a 17-yard touchdown pass to cut the score, 20-17, but the Broncos' held the ball for the rest of the game and ran out the clock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe56b59dbe1633e7ba4145975759d1b920df926","amp;dn":"1977+-+AFC+Championship+%28Den+20+Oak+17%29+DVD+Rip+%5BNFL+Football%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe56b59dbe1633e7ba4145975759d1b920df926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,229,107,89,219,225,99,62,123,164,20,89,117,117,157,27,146,13,249,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
