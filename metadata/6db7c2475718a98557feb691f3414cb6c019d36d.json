When a cataclysmic nuclear bombing devastates New York and kills millions, eight strangers take refuge in the basement of their apartment building, a converted fallout shelter designed by their paranoid superintendent Mickey. With just three connecting rooms it is barely big enough, but with stockpiles of food and water, the group is at least safe from the horrors outside, and they settle in and attempt to fathom the catastrophe that has ended the lives of so many of their loved ones.\n\nCast:\nLauren German ...
