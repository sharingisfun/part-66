The all-new season sees Billy hit the road for the first time, in search of challenges that are bigger, better and badder than ever. Whether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going after giant pythons in the Florida Everglades, wrestling 10-foot gators in Texas, chasing a herd of razor-toothed javelina in Arizona, or fighting off an aerial attack by 30-pound geese in North Carolina, Billy comes to the rescue with humor, compassionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and a whole lot of attitude. Billy runs Vexcon, one of Louisiana's busiest pest removal companies, with the help of his brother Ricky, whom he describes as &quot;just as crazy as me,&quot; his father Bill Sr., and his sassy mom Donnie, who runs the office.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d91739260d60c06671ca6a7845f5bc1634716a65","amp;dn":"Billy+The+Exterminator+Season+4+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d91739260d60c06671ca6a7845f5bc1634716a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,23,57,38,13,96,192,102,113,202,106,120,69,245,188,22,52,113,106,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
