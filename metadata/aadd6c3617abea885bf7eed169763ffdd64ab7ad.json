While upset at home with his wife Lisa, David sees a man near his car; when he approaches, the stranger sprays some chemicals on his face and David becomes blind. Later David receives a message in his answering machine with the proposal of Dr. Guillermo List for recovering his vision and he offers anything to regain his sight.
