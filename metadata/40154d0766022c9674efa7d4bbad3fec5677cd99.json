It is based upon the popular Wing Commander series by Chris Roberts and Origin, and features a new story line during the final portion of the Terran Confederations deseprate fight for survivial against the Kilrathi Empire. You assume the role of 2nd Lieutenant David Markham, a recent OCS graduate in an accelerated flight training program. Victory and survival for humanity can only be bought at a terrible cost. Gather your wingmen and your courage and prepare to play your part in humanity's desperate gambit as you face the Kilrathi foe. It is a time where even average men must reach inside themselves and become heroes. Answer the call. Face the enemy. Make your mark as the Confederation faces its darkest dawn.\n\n\nIt is a time of desperation and despair. Still reeling from the ghastly toll of the Battle of Terra, humanity finds itself pushed closer and closer to the brink of extinction at the hands and claws of the savage Kilrathi Empire. The Confederation is trapped in a seemingly endless cycle of defeats, and hope is slipping away. Already, the Kilrathi are making their final preparations to finish off humanity once and for all. The end, it seems, is near.\n\nIn this setting, human drama is at its most extreme intensity. Hope, fear, desperation, courage, camaraderie, and loss are part of the daily struggle for the people who refuse to stop fighting, even in the face of seemingly inevitable defeat. This is humanity's greatest struggle, its defining moment. This is the Wing Commander Saga.\n\nFeatures\n\n    * Over nine hours of voice dialogue.\n    * Approximately 70 cut scenes for a total of about 90 minutes of pre-rendered footage (not counting in-flight communications and command briefings).\n    * Over 60 voice actors, some of whom are actual professionals.\n    * 221 voice acting roles.\n    * 55 missions.\n    * Achievements (mission performance is evaluated and rewarded).\n    * 90 models created for Saga.\n    * Download size of 3,3 GB with an installation size of 8 GB.\n\nThe computer game which supplies the background world in which Wing Commander Saga is set is the all-time bestseller. We believe that familiarity with either one of the games (Wing Commander 1-4) or one of the novels (preferably End Run, Fleet Action, The Heart of the Tiger) will intensify enjoyment of the Wing Commander Saga. \n\n\nmd5 hashes, make sure those match\n\n3df7604e65395a72872c4dede8993ef6 *darkest-dawn-setup.dat\n227f61bd07a2197221fcbf49d5f4c235 *darkest-dawn-setup.exe\n6acfacf7b1ca5a34d81dacc3ad3a1d1c *darkest-dawn-setup32.dll\n65132f1296e7bc0f6d080000223e84e2 *Disk0001.tiz\n170ded38519c2c5a0c5329f808644b11 *Disk0002.tiz\n2d7c947eb5312afed4ccd5d56103df84 *Disk0003.tiz\nbe80605979f9ddc0707f41bd90ba5420 *Disk0004.tiz\nc6ab9f9e316d248fe57d06812e8596ca *Disk0005.tiz\n1cade73603e32259e996417b3d486ff8 *Update/darkest-dawn-1.1.0.7822-setup.exe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40154d0766022c9674efa7d4bbad3fec5677cd99","amp;dn":"Wing+Commander+Saga%3A+The+Darkest+Dawn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40154d0766022c9674efa7d4bbad3fec5677cd99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,21,77,7,102,2,44,150,116,239,167,212,187,173,63,236,86,119,205,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
