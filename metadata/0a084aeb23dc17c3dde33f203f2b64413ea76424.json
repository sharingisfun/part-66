Never mind that Humpty Dumpty and Puss in Boots had a falling out years ago, or that Jack and Jill are completely preoccupied by their squabbling over whether or not to have a child--and regardless that Puss in Boots is a wanted cat who's sworn off his thieving ways, and Kitty Softpaws is a cat burglar who works alone. Comedy abounds in this film, not only in the twists and turns of some classic fairy tales gone awry, but with scenes that range from a litter-box dance fight between crowds of cats to Jack expressing his paternal instincts by strapping on a baby carrier filled with a piglet in a diaper, and, of course, Puss in Boots' crafty use of his famous sad eyes to get just what he wants. The animation is top-notch (especially in the mass cat scenes), the music is compelling, and the voice talents of Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Zack Galifianakis\n********************\nIMDB Rating: 6.8\n\nimdb: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448694/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448694/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nyoutube  \n\n\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 5 140 Kbps\nLength            : 3.24 GiB for 1h 30mn 14s 560ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 4 499 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a084aeb23dc17c3dde33f203f2b64413ea76424","amp;dn":"Puss++In+Boots+-2011+720p+BDRip+x264+ac3-5.1-+subs-+%28mp4%29+%5BX%40720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a084aeb23dc17c3dde33f203f2b64413ea76424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,8,74,235,35,220,23,195,221,227,63,32,63,43,100,65,62,167,100,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
