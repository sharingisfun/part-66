A simple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdouble-click-and-dragÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ paradigm is used to place control points on a photo, and clever edge detection localises and interpolates your lightness adjustments around and between these points. Results are rapid, without compromising on the extra controls needed to achieve subtle refinements.\n\nIndii.org is pleased to announce the release of its second photographic application and plugin: Urban Lightscape. Use Urban Lightscape to correct exposure, make localised brightness adjustments, dodge and burn, and introduce artificial lighting to a scene.\n\nUse Urban LightscapeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦for those subjects that deserve better exposure than you got in-camera\nUse Urban Lightscape to correct under- and overexposed parts of an image.
