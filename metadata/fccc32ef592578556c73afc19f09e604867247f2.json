Their worldwide sales have reached over 80 million albums.\n A 2005 USA Today opinion poll named Journey the fifth best American rock band in history. Their songs have become arena rock staples and are still played on rock radio stations across the world. \n[From Wikipedia]\n\n\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nThe probability of someone watching you is proportional to the stupidity of your action\n\n Ciao from the italian Alps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fccc32ef592578556c73afc19f09e604867247f2","amp;dn":"JOURNEY+-+A+Taste+by+Pete+Hollow+-+mp3%40320+%5BTNT+Village%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fccc32ef592578556c73afc19f09e604867247f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,204,50,239,89,37,120,85,108,115,175,193,159,9,230,4,134,114,71,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
