Hoping that a change of  \n\nscenery would produce better academic performance, Kubrick's father Jack (a \n\nphysician) sent him in 1940 to Pasadena, California, to stay with his uncle Martin \n\nPerveler. Returning to the Bronx in 1941 for his last year of grammar school, there \n\nseemed to be little change in his attitude or his results. Hoping to find something \n\nto interest his son,Jack introduced Stanley to chess, with the desired result.  \n\nKubrick took to the game passionately, and quickly became a skilled player. Chess \n\nwould become an important device for Kubrick in later years, often as a tool for \n\ndealing with recalcitrant actors, but also as an artistic motif in his films. This \n\ntorrent consists of master's all directed movies and documentaries,including his \n\nfirst movie fear and desire.\n\nThe movies present here are:\n\n     Flying Padre(Short doc)       1951\n     \n     Day of the fight(Short doc)   1951\n     \n     Fear and Desire               1952\n     \n     The seafarers(Short)          1953\n     \n     Killer's kiss                 1955\n     \n     The Killing                   1956\n     \n     Paths of glory                1957\n     \n     Spartacus                     1962\n     \n     Lolita                        1962\n     \n     Dr. Strangelove               1964\n     \n     2001: A space odyssey         1968\n     \n     A clockwork orange            1971\n     \n     Barry Lyndon                  1975\n     \n     The shinning                  1980\n     \n     Full metal Jacket             1987\n     \n     Eyes wide shut                1999","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7555d465bf676d56faf77ed5254b6f361b673c07","amp;dn":"Stanley+Kubrick+platinum+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7555d465bf676d56faf77ed5254b6f361b673c07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,85,212,101,191,103,109,86,250,247,126,213,37,75,111,54,27,103,60,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
