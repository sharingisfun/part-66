By the\nfirst of April 2012 we will change our packaging ways to RAR/SFV\nand put the old ZIP/RAR/DIZ packaging to rest. It is long overdue,\nand this ancient way of packing has no meaning in 2012. We\nstrongly encourage all other groups to do the same - and site\noperators, all you need to do is to add the 0DAY path to the\nSFV path of your setup, and your site will during the transition\nperiod do fine with both packaging standards. It's time to\nmove forward.\n\n+ I N S T A L L +\n\n1) Unpack and install.\n2) When prompted locate the included keyfile.\n3) Enjoy this release!\n\nNOTE: For obvious reasons you should always make sure that\nthe title is restricted access to internet by a firewall\nto avoid any problems. Further, when running our\nkeygens/patches you might need to run it with admin\nrights while in Vista/Win7 to ensure that it has\nenough privileges.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1c2552fe12bcfadecd7af10a02339a5f24bc3f7","amp;dn":"SynaptiCAD.Product.Suite.v17.01r-Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1c2552fe12bcfadecd7af10a02339a5f24bc3f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,194,85,47,225,43,207,173,236,215,175,16,160,35,57,165,242,75,195,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
