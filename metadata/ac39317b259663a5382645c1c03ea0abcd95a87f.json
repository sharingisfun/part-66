Your only hope for survival (and escape) is your superior intellect and your fast reflexes. This game is a first-person shooter that reminds many gamers of classics like DOOM and QUAKE. On the menu, you'll find weapons, battle bosses, and run and strafe your way through a seemingly endless army of malevolent aliens. This game was originally on the all-but-forgotten 3DO. Control is much improved over the original, with the PlayStation controller's extra buttons making things a little easier. The number of moves your chef character can pull off is impressive, considering the basic gameplay of run-and-strafe found in most first-person shooters. Not only can you run and shoot, but you can also jump, fly, and even do backflips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac39317b259663a5382645c1c03ea0abcd95a87f","amp;dn":"Po%27ed+%5BPSX%2C+NTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac39317b259663a5382645c1c03ea0abcd95a87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,57,49,123,37,150,99,165,56,38,69,193,192,62,160,171,205,149,168,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
