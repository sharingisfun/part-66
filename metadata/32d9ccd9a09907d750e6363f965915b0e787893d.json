(provided that widget fits)\n- Almost real like tile animation\n- Almost real like tile re-arrange mode\n- Almost real like status bar\n- Animated contacts tile (supports G+ synced contacts)\n- Pinnable contact-tile which animates like the real phone\n- Folder tiles\n- Webpage tiles\n- Filterable application list\n- Stock wp7-like colors and color selection\n\nFAQ:\n\n- Initial setup may be broken depending on your phone manufacturer, you probably need to replace the tiles\n- To add new application to main screen, long press on an application in application drawer and select &quot;pin to home screen&quot;\n- Filtered apps can be restored from the launcher settings fitered apps page\n- Tiles can be made transparent by adjusting the alpha value from the horizontal bar on the color selector\n- All bitmaps must fit inside 48 megabyte heap (high-end phones, lower-end phones even less than that), so don't try to use too many 25 megabyte bitmaps on your tiles or you will see FC.\n- Gmail tile will not work anymore, use Mail tile instead\n- By default WP7 statusbar shows icons only if you touch it. You can adjust the functionality from statusbar options\n- &quot;Smaller tiles&quot; will make 1x1 tile to 172x172 pixels in HDPI resolution. I managed to measure the tiles wrong when I started developing L7 and tiles have been too big ever since. 172x172 tiles seem to be faster too, so I suggest you to try them!\n\nTODO-list:\n- folder of contacts tile\n- revamp the application icon addition (allow text color selection etc)\n- App integration (Twitter, Facebook etc.)\n- two-sided tiles\n- cropping tool to make custom bitmap selection easier\n\nChangelog \n\n&gt; Version 1.1.5\n- Picture hub is now available\n- Shortcuts can be assigned to tiles [BIG NOTE: you can only add shortcut to an existing app tile, so pin something from app drawer and modify it to contain shortcut]\n- Wp7-style statusbar has been updated\n- fixed an issue with background polling\n- error reporting updated\n- Create default tiles-button will now show only once, L7 settings will let you create the default tiles if you miss the prompt\n\n&gt; 1.1.5.5: enabled large heap on ICS to reduce OOM:s\n- added warning to picture hub\n- OOMing picture hub or contact tile shouldn't block rendering the rest of the tiles (unless they run out of memory too, in which case you are totally out of luck)\n- Data connectivity state is no longer displayed if data connection is off\n- Couple of stupid crashes fixed\n\n&gt; Version 1.1.4\n- rotating tiles have made an epic return\n- orientation lock on the first page will enable / disable real landscape mode, the rotating tiles is back in animation options and will have function ONLY and ONLY if you lock the orientation to portrait\n- sluggish ICS scrolling fixed [really, this time I actually activated the APK :P ]\n- fixed issue where async loader no longer delivered new contact images to contact tiles\n- fixed issue where multiple contact tiles wasted extra memory\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\n_ application caching added\n&gt; 1.1.6.1 - uninstall crash fixed\n&gt; 1.1.6.2 - stock accent no longer messes up global theme color\n&gt; 1.1.6.4 - some tuning to cache process, attempts to avoid duplicate entries\n&gt; 1.1.6.5 - more tweaks for duplicates while caching\n\nScreenshots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img864.imageshack.us/img864/1367/001aiq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img864.imageshack.us/img864/1367/001aiq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/333/002wfha.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/333/002wfha.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/1939/003clf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/1939/003clf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy and Please SeeD :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d9ccd9a09907d750e6363f965915b0e787893d","amp;dn":"Launcher+7+-+Donate+v1.1.6.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d9ccd9a09907d750e6363f965915b0e787893d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,217,204,217,160,153,7,215,80,230,54,63,150,89,21,176,231,135,137,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
