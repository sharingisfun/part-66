There are only 5 :-)\n\n\nYou will find a whole load of material including:\n\n- Music (Amiga/C64/A2600/DMG)\n\n- Videos including Live @ Blip Japan 2011\n\n- Bonus music (other non-chip unreleased stuff + weekly beats)\n\n- Atari 2600 dev software (Windows)\n\n- Amiga Disk Files for Emulator (Win/Mac/Linux)\n\n- A guide to using an Amiga emulator and how to mount ADF files\n\n\nAll content (except software) is Creative Commons, 2011.\n\nMost of the tunes are at least semi-mastered, and are recorded direct. \nThe Gameboy stuff is pretty raw for the most part.  I had lots of \nrequests to leave it untouched, so I just sequnced the live tracks \nand hit record.\n\nPlease note that the software is &quot;as is&quot; and used at your own risk.\nThis is a read / write device so I take no responsibility for the\nsoftware or anything that has happened to it since it left my PC!\n\nThanks for your support and look out for more releases in the future.\n\nSend me a greet on the cTrix facebook page if you get a chance.  Let me know which number you got!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aaa5550ddd5e2ec45c5a4471b3c848e57ac28c8","amp;dn":"cTrix+USB+Bottle+Opener+Mk+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aaa5550ddd5e2ec45c5a4471b3c848e57ac28c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,170,85,80,221,213,226,236,69,197,164,71,27,60,132,142,87,172,40,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
