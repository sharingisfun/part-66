It stars Suresh Gopi and Parthiban in the lead roles, and features Ashokan, Thalaivasal Vijay, Nizhalgal Ravi, Krishnakumar and Sanjay in other pivotal roles. An adaptation of Soorya Krishna Moorthy's stage play of the same name, which itself was based on the Hindi play Court Martial by Swadesh Deepak, the film reached theatres on 29 April 2011. It received wide critical acclaim upon release and got a dubbed release in Tamil as Ulvilaasam.\nThe film does not feature any woman character (expect the girl child of Sawar Ramachandran) or songs. The entire film was shot inside a room and filming was completed in just nine days. Another noteworthy feature about the film is that the film evolves in real-time. Sticking close to the Aristotelian unities, the screen time of an hour and half dovetails perfectly with real time.\nThe film traces the progress of a court martial of a Dalit soldier, Sawar Ramachandran (Parthiban), who has been accused of killing Capt. Verma and attempting to kill Capt. Kapoor (Krishnakumar), while on guard duty. There are eyewitnesses who have noted that the incident happened in a fit of rage but are clueless about what actually transpired before Ramachandran used his weapon and even Ramachandran has pleaded guilty without being ready to disclose anything else. Prosecutor Capt. Ajay Suri (Nizhalgal Ravi) has every intention to set the noose hanging and ready for Ramachandran. From the outset, Captain Vikas Ray (Suresh Gopi), who defends the accused, is pessimistic about his chances of saving his client. But, still, he is bent on finding the truth behind the incident. And the truth is an eye opener for the army as well as society.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26201fe9494e0cd7102f6cfbbeb85565ce8c464f","amp;dn":"Melvilasam+%28Malayalam+2011%29++DvDRiP+CPSArvind.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26201fe9494e0cd7102f6cfbbeb85565ce8c464f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,32,31,233,73,78,12,215,16,47,108,251,190,184,85,101,206,140,70,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
