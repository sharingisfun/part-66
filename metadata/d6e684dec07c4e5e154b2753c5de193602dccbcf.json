He writes the melody with Lord Lloyd Webber, but he wants performers from around the Commonwealth to play on it. Prince Charles gives Gary some suggestions, and Gary then embarks on an extraordinary trip, recording all manner of musicians on their home turfs to make the unique record, Sing.\n\nMusicians include a children's choir in Kenya, Rastafarian drummers in Jamaica, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in Australia, pan-pipers in a remote rainforest village on the Solomon Islands, and Gareth Malone's Military Wives Choir in the UK. Gary also manages to get Prince Harry to make his own musical contribution.\n\nA record like this has never been attempted before, and the pressure is on for Gary, as he has a royal appointment to present it to the Queen herself.\n\n\n\n\nAspect Ratio......: 16:9\nResolution: 1280x720\nFPS.......: 25.000\nVideo Codec: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nLanguage: English.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6e684dec07c4e5e154b2753c5de193602dccbcf","amp;dn":"The+Diamond+Jubilee+-+Gary+Barlow+On+Her+Majestys+Service","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6e684dec07c4e5e154b2753c5de193602dccbcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,230,132,222,192,124,78,94,21,75,39,83,197,222,25,54,2,220,203,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
