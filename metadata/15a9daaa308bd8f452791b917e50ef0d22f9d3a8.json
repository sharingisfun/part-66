After messing around for a couple of hours and reading around the net I figured out what was wrong with everyones collection and collected all the proper files. So this is just a re-compilation of most of what's on here + a working v1.4 no-cd patch.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThanks goes out to: \n\ndjDEVASTATE - whose iso and patch 1.2 was used in this collection, and whose files made me realize why others didn't work.\n\nRouge1423 - whose patch 1.4 was used in this collection (btw your no-cd crack is for v1.0 and thats why so many people have problems with yours.)\n\nInferno - whose members provided the no-cd patch for the 1.4 version (pretty much only working one I found so Thank You)\n\nFirst torrent and upload speeds limited to 100 KB/s so please be patient :P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15a9daaa308bd8f452791b917e50ef0d22f9d3a8","amp;dn":"Monopoly+Tycoon+with+All+Patches+and+No-CD+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15a9daaa308bd8f452791b917e50ef0d22f9d3a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,169,218,170,48,139,216,244,82,121,27,145,126,80,239,13,34,249,211,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
