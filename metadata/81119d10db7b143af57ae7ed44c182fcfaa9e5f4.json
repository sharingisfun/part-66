(Originally created by morphinapg.)\n\n=====================================================\n\nConsidering this is the best game series I've ever played, and certainly the most cinematic, I decided to make them into movies. I decided that I would include every cinematic, and link them by the minimum gameplay needed to connect the cinematics without creating any plot holes. Obviously to do this I had to take out certain sections of gameplay, but doing so does not have any effect on story. As I was trying to make these as close to a real movie experience as I could, there were a few guidelines I decided to follow:\n\n1. I would try to remove as many on screen references to this being a game as possible, such as chapter titles and button or new ammo prompts. Some of these would either be impossible or would too much negatively impact the quality of the film, such as the near constant ammo OSD, or the occasional &quot;select&quot; prompt for drake's journal during puzzles.\n\n2. I would try to include as much of the puzzles, in game cinematics and cinematic gameplay elements as I could. Some areas still needed to be cut to keep the movie flowing properly or, in the case of Uncharted 2 and 3, to keep the run length shorter than it would have been otherwise.\n\n3. I tried to keep as much in game dialogue as I could, as I believe those really help develop the characters. However, as I said, I also had to keep an eye on how much gameplay I was using to make sure it didn't make things too boring or make the movie too long.\n\nIn the end, my goal was to make a movie that would be watchable whether the viewer was a fan of Uncharted or not, and whether the viewer was a video game player or not. My initial reason was to find a way to show the story of these games to people in my family who don't play video games. I think I succeeded.\n\nHowever, remember that these movies WERE created from video games that are much longer when played through, so they will be quite long to watch. Here are the run lengths for all three:\n\nUncharted 1: 113 minutes\nUncharted 2: 177 minutes\nUncharted 3: 195 minutes\n\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n=====================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81119d10db7b143af57ae7ed44c182fcfaa9e5f4","amp;dn":"Uncharted+-+The+Movie+%281%2C+2+%26amp%3B+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81119d10db7b143af57ae7ed44c182fcfaa9e5f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,17,157,16,219,123,20,58,245,122,231,237,68,193,130,252,250,169,229,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
