Why Government Fails, but Individuals Succeed (also the title of my new book) airs tonight on Fox News.\n\nPoliticians say &quot;Yes, we can!&quot; and claim they solve our problems.\n\nWhen the mortgage market crashed, the President said their new law, Dodd-Frank, would create a &quot;new financial system&quot; so such things would never happen again.\n\nAfter 9/11, Senator Tom Daschle declared &quot;you can't professionalize if you don't federalize!&quot; The Senate voted 100-0 to create the TSA to run airport security.\n\nPoliticians' promises are endless. They say they'll: create jobs, &quot;make college affordable for all,&quot; protect the disabled, give disadvantaged kids a head start, and invest in &quot;cutting edge innovation.&quot;\n\nBut they can't achieve what they promise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e4827784cace3c4e989eaf9a2a651e20f88c565","amp;dn":"20120406-Stossel+Special-%5BNo+They+Can%27t%5D.Fox+News+Channel.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e4827784cace3c4e989eaf9a2a651e20f88c565","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,72,39,120,76,172,227,196,233,137,234,249,162,166,81,226,15,136,197,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
