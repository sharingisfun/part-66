They are supported by Phillip Broyles, the force's director, and Agent Astrid Farnsworth, who assists Walter in laboratory research. The Fringe Division investigates cases relating to fringe science, ranging from transhumanist experiments gone wrong to the prospect of a destructive technological singularity to a possible collision of two parallel universes. The Fringe Division's work often intersects with advanced biotechnology developed by a company called Massive Dynamic, founded by Walter's former partner, Dr. William Bell, and run by their common friend, Nina Sharp. The team is also watched silently by a group of bald, pale men who are called &quot;Observers&quot;.\n\n\nCODEC #___________________ X264\nRESOLUTION #______________ 1280x720\nASPECT RATIO #____________ 16:9\nFRAME RATE #______________ 23.976 fps\nAverage RUNTIME #_________________ 43min \nBIT RATE #________________ 2694 Kbps\nSOURCE #__________________ DIMENSION\nLANGUAGE #________________ English\n\nENCODING AUDIO INFORMATION:\n\nCODEC #___________________ AAC\nBIT RATE #________________ 384 Kbps\nCHANNELS #________________ 2\nCHANNELS POSITION #_______ Front: L C \n\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++DIMENSION+++eztv+++Legendas+++United\n                                      and the release groups\n2HD,ASAP,FQM,LOL,IMMERSE,FEVER,SYS,ORENJI,REWARD,SPASTiKUS,MiXED,MOMENTUM, and all the others (too many to mention them all)\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\nSeason 04 Complete\n\n\nFringe.S04.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION\n\n\nLengendas PT-BR by UNITED\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a569b3779ce2d41be78214f0a3c667f5664a00f1","amp;dn":"Fringe.S04E01.720p.HDTV.X264-COMPLETE-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a569b3779ce2d41be78214f0a3c667f5664a00f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,105,179,119,156,226,212,27,231,130,20,240,163,198,103,245,102,74,0,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
