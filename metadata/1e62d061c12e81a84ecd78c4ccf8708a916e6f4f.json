On a PC running Windows XP or Windows Vista, a third-party program is required to convert an ISO file into installable mediaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and DVD burning software often includes this capability. One option is the USB/DVD download tool provided by the Microsoft Store. You can also download Windows 8 Consumer Preview Setup, which includes tools that allow you to create a DVD or USB flash drive from an ISO file (Windows Vista or Windows 7 required).\n\nNote before you download:\nWindows 8 Consumer Preview is prerelease software that may be substantially modified before itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s commercially released.
