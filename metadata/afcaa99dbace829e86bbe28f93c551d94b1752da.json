Detectives look for a witness.\n\nInto the police office walks Min Soo-Ah (Kim Ha-Neul). She used to be a promising cadet at the police academy, but after a horrific car accident which killed her brother, Soo-Ah's police career ended. Min Soo-Ah also lost her eyesight in the car accident. Min Soo-Ah reveals to Detective Jo (Jo Hie-Bong) at the police station that on the night of the hit and run case she was picked up by a taxi cab driver. Soo-Ah believes the taxi driver may be the perpetrator of the crimes. Initially, Detective Jo doesn't take Soo-Ah's claims seriously because she is blind, but when Soo-Ah displays her acute senses the detective starts to believe her.\n\nDetective Jo and Min Soo-Ah then work together to find the taxi cab driver, but all their leads turn up empty. Then another witness comes forward Kwon Ki-Sub (Yoo Seung-Ho). Kwon Ki-Sub is a motorcycle delivery boy who claims to have also witness the hit and run incident. Kwon Ki-Sub also emphatically states that the car in question was not a taxi cab, but rather an imported sedan.\n\nMeanwhile, Min Soo-Ah finds herself being stalked by a mysterious man ... \n\nCast: Ha-Neul Kim, Seung-Ho Yoo, Hie-bong Jo, Mi-Kyeong Kim","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afcaa99dbace829e86bbe28f93c551d94b1752da","amp;dn":"Beulraindeu+-+Blind+%2A2011%2A+%5BDVDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON%5D+%5BSUB+PL%2FENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afcaa99dbace829e86bbe28f93c551d94b1752da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,202,169,157,186,206,130,158,134,187,226,143,147,197,81,217,75,23,82,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
