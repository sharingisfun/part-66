Just Painkiller and nothing else matters!\nThis time youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re fighting for the freedom of your soul, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to need all your strength and courage in order to break free from a prison located in the darkest corner of the Purgatory.\nAction takes place in some completely unknown areas of the underworld. These areas donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look ordinary at all. Each level is a brand new world, a universe with its own unique atmosphere, history and mysteries.\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to fight with the undead in an old gloomy abbey, on a ruined as if by an earthquakespeedway with roads and turns twisting like circles of Hell. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be hunting demons amongst numerous crypts and tombs of an old London cemetery. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be cleansing the old warehouse, decaying and shrouded in darkness and terror. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to stop occult rituals in an old temple complex lost somewhere in the jungle.\nMed-Art about the game:\nWe make the new Painkiller with all our heart and soul because we love what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing. Once you play Painkiller you get hooked up on it. We were so deeply amazed by its astonishing atmosphere that we still highly admire it. Sometimes you think that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not you who chooses Painkiller but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Painkiller that chooses you.\n\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80618d833797f9caf57dc26c9d222e0f6181bacd","amp;dn":"Painkiller.Recurring.Evil-SKIDROW%28Murlok%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80618d833797f9caf57dc26c9d222e0f6181bacd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,97,141,131,55,151,249,202,245,125,194,108,157,34,46,15,97,129,186,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
