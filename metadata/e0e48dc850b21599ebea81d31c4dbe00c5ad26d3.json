You know the genre....some masked nut case chases down and creatively murders a group of attractive teenagers with poor decision making skills, who have unleashed the killer's repressed psychosexual anger. These movies are associated withfun. They're low brow entertainment to take a hot date too.But for Cassie Hack, this ain't nomovie. Cassie, the daughter of the notorious Slasher, the Lunch Lady, travels the world with her monstrous partner, Vlad, hunting and destroying Slashers where ever they may be, whatever form they may take. But Cassie may have met her match. The residents of the small town of Eminence, Indiana are becoming victims, one-by-one, of a viscous undead killer and his army of zombie pets. Cassie and Vlad will have to wade, hip deep, through undead hamsters, cats, and dogs to save a beautiful veterinarian from a monster that makes all thoseSlashers look like Mother Teresa.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e48dc850b21599ebea81d31c4dbe00c5ad26d3","amp;dn":"HACK-SLASH+-+EUTHANIZED+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e48dc850b21599ebea81d31c4dbe00c5ad26d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,228,141,200,80,178,21,153,235,234,129,211,28,77,190,0,197,173,38,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
