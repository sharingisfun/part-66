Written by Jonathan Swift; Full-cast dramatisation starring Arthur Darvill as Gulliver; Dramatised by Matthew Broughton.\n\nEpisode 1:\n\nGulliver is shipwrecked on the Island of Lilliput where the natives are tiny people living in a miniature society. With his unique overview of this realm, Gulliver discovers a world of petty politics and small minds. Coerced into a war between two nations who disagree on the best way to eat boiled eggs, Gulliver finds himself betrayed by friends and battered by enemies - escape is his only option if he wants to survive!\n\nEpisode 2:\n\nGulliver's adventures continue when he finds himself in Brobdingnag - a land where the inhabitants are enormous! Here, as a miniature man, Gulliver must fight for survival against rats the size of dogs, a dwarf who is 40 foot high, and the ridicule and humiliation of a scornful court.\n\nWith his uniquely close-up view, Gulliver sees the people (even the great beauties) as if under a microscope - and they are dirty, stinking and disgusting. He becomes increasingly horrified by humankind, stranded in a frightening land where his only ally is an innocent child. Once again, escape is imperative - if he doesn't, he won't survive...\n\nEpisode 3:\n\nGulliver finds himself on the floating Island of Laputa, where he encounters mad scientists and the terrifying ghosts of the great and the good. He flees from these intellectual and spiritual horrors, only to finally find a kind of Eden with the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent and gentle horses. However, in this land, humans - or as they are called, the 'Yahoos' - are considered vermin!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59d1c7e49960712faa9863565f41f74a6e5fa0bb","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Swift+-+Gulliver%5C%27s+Travels+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59d1c7e49960712faa9863565f41f74a6e5fa0bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,209,199,228,153,96,113,47,170,152,99,86,95,65,247,74,110,95,160,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
