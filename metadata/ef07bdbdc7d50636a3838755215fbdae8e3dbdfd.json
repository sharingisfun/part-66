She was also a sceptic Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially when it came to 'close encounters'. But driving home with her husband from a party late one evening along a lonely road in country Victoria, she was dazzled by a blinding light.\n\nWhat happened next was at first too frightening to remember Ã¢â‚¬â€ until it became too terrifying to forget. As Kelly pieced together her memories of that fateful encounter, one detail stood out. There were other people there that night, people she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know or speak to. When researchers finally tracked them down, their story was eerily similar.\n\nEncounter is Kelly's story, her own, very personal account of an experience for which she has no rational explanation and that has totally changed her life. Sometimes frightening, sometimes gut wrenching and sometimes out of this world, it is a story that poses more questions than it answers. When you've read Encounter you'll discover, like Kelly, why a close encounter is impossible to forget.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef07bdbdc7d50636a3838755215fbdae8e3dbdfd","amp;dn":"Kelly+Cahill+-+Encounter+-+UFO+eBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef07bdbdc7d50636a3838755215fbdae8e3dbdfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,7,189,189,199,213,6,54,163,131,135,85,33,95,189,174,142,61,189,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
