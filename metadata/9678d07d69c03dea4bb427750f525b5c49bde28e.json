At the time it was the longest-range \nbombing mission in history.\n\nFrom start to finish, the seemingly impossible mission was a comedy of errors, held together \nby pluck and ingenuity.\n\nOn the brink of being scrapped, only three of the ageing nuclear bombers could be fitted out \nfor war, one to fly the mission and two in reserve. Crucial spare parts were scavenged from \nmuseums and scrap yards - one vital component had been serving as an ashtray in the Officers\nMess.\n\nIn just three weeks, the Vulcan crews had to learn air-to-air refuelling, which they hadn't \ndone for 20 years, and conventional bombing, which they hadn't done for 10 years either.\n\nThe RAF scoured the country for Second World War iron bombs, and complex refuelling calculations \nwere done the night before on a Ã‚Â£5 pocket calculator.\n\nWith a plan stretched to the limit and the RAF's hopes riding on just one Vulcan, the mission was \nflown on a knife-edge: fraught with mechanical failures, unreliable navigation, electrical storms \nand lack of fuel.\n\nOf the 21 bombs the Vulcan dropped, only one found its target. But it was enough to change the \noutcome of the war.\n\nAstonishingly, this great feat has been downplayed into near obscurity by history, but this \ndocumentary brings it back to life, providing a thrilling and uncharacteristically upbeat account \nfrom the Falklands War: the Dambusters for the 1980s generation...\n\nFirst Shown\n\nSunday 18 March 2012\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/YyUlH.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/YyUlH.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n47mn 0s | 505 MiB | 720x400 | 1502 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 240 Kbps Vbr | 2 ch | QF 0.181| Documentary | TV quality | English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9678d07d69c03dea4bb427750f525b5c49bde28e","amp;dn":"ch4+-+Falklands%27+Most+Daring+Raid+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9678d07d69c03dea4bb427750f525b5c49bde28e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,120,208,125,105,192,61,234,75,180,39,117,15,82,91,92,73,189,226,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
