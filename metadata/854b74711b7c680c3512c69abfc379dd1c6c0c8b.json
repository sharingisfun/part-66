It expires oct 2012. I have been using this for about a week now and it appears it does not phone home. There are a few added features to this disk and a couple menues added. i created the torrent not as an iso but in a folder file, unrar should not be necessary but if so do as you please. For the noobs take the contents of the folder use img burn to make an iso then burn to a cd cd-rw is preferable so you can use isoinjector to add updates to the disk but any cd or dvd will work.\n\n\n\nThis is my first torrent, enjoy and please give me feedback. Thank You.\n\n    -BMF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:854b74711b7c680c3512c69abfc379dd1c6c0c8b","amp;dn":"GEEK+SQUAD+MRI+5.6.0++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"854b74711b7c680c3512c69abfc379dd1c6c0c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,75,116,113,27,124,104,12,53,18,198,154,191,195,121,221,28,108,12,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
