If you know how to fix that, please leave a comment.\n\nYear: 1997\nMageSlayer is a top down Action RPG from the creators of Hexen and Heretic. The engine is similar to Take No Prisoners. There are 4 character classes to choose from and an inventory system.\nGameplay is similar to the old arcade hit Gauntlet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508495e776485f5cdd868247cea5fbba975512eb","amp;dn":"MageSlayer+1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508495e776485f5cdd868247cea5fbba975512eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,132,149,231,118,72,95,92,221,134,130,71,206,165,251,186,151,85,18,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
