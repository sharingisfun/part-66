He infers a lesson for the US.\n\nStuart Varney\n\n- on how the government is subsidizing the rich with all the green energy incentives. After all, who's going to buy the green electric cars with true costs north of $100K. He explains how we're being bribed with our own money.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2600330e42863bfdb70d79259eb14b4dce9c5710","amp;dn":"20120216-Varney+%26amp%3B+Co+%28excerpt%29.Fox+Business+Network.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2600330e42863bfdb70d79259eb14b4dce9c5710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,0,51,14,66,134,59,253,183,13,121,37,158,177,75,77,206,156,87,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
