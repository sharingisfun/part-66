What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 5 - Friday - Gary goes into chef mode when he puts himself up against the clock in a 30 minute real time challenge. Later Gary is joined by Lorraine Pascale of Ella's Cupcake in Covent Garden.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57b6777e5154e7171bdab9afb658ca40e4306724","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E30.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57b6777e5154e7171bdab9afb658ca40e4306724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,182,119,126,81,84,231,23,27,218,185,175,182,88,202,64,228,48,103,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
