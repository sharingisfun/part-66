Edgar Hoover was feared and admired, reviled and revered. But behind closed doors, he held secrets that would have destroyed his image, his career and his life.\nThe film opens with Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) in his office during his later years. He asks that a writer (Ed Westwick) be let in, so that he may tell the story of the origin of the FBI for the sake of the public. Hoover explains that the story begins in 1919, when A. Mitchell Palmer was Attorney General and Hoover's boss at the Justice Department. Palmer suffers an assassination attempt, but is unharmed when the bomb explodes earlier than intended. \n\nNOTES : RippeR brings to you another high quality release in small size. English Subtitles added. Check sample before downloading :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5f438746f62ade1eb4f4242a352ed7d78a6e589","amp;dn":"J+Edgar+%5B2011%5D+550MB+BRRip+x264-RippeR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5f438746f62ade1eb4f4242a352ed7d78a6e589","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,244,56,116,111,98,173,225,235,79,66,66,163,82,237,125,120,166,229,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
