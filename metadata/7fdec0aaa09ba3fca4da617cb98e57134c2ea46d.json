He wrote his first song in 1960. After that, he started composing many songs and advanced his co-operation with many new singers. In the late 1960s, he co-operated with the then 19-years old George Dalaras. He wrote Dalaras' first songs and helped him to emerge as one of the most important and successful Greek singers.\n\nKouyioumtzis has to show various co-operations with some of the most important Greek singers, Anna Vissi, Haris Alexiou, Yiannis Parios, Eleftheria Arvanitaki and Giorgos Kalatzis. He had, also, co-operated in many songs with the poet-lyricist Manos Eleftheriou.\n\nKouyioumtzis songs are regarded as top-quality music in Greece. Moreover, in many of his songs he himself wrote the lyrics; wonderful lyrics. Every Kouyioumtzis' song contains a message; either of love, poverty or the agony of the poor to live with dignity. \nAccording to lyricist Lefteris Papadopoulos, Kouyioumtzis &quot;followed the music spirit which was dominant in Greece during the last 25 years (from 1965 to 1990) through the music of Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis&quot;. However, it is clear that Kouyioumtzis music is something different; has its own unique type and character.\n\nIt is generally acceptable that Stavros Kouyioumtzis was a character of calm disposition and an excellent man in the field of Greek music. A bashful character himself, it is characteristic that Kouyioumtzis was not appearing in the media, except on special occasions.\n\nDuring the last few years he left Athens and moved back to his birthplace, Thessaloniki, where he continued working on music and songs until he died suddenly on 12 March 2005. His funeral took place at the Cathedral in the Municipality of Kalamaria and he was buried at the cemetery of Kalamaria, in East Thessaloniki.
