To the dismay of his childhood friend, Kei, Hiro starts hanging out with Miyako. But Kei is not about to let a new girl in Hiro's life take him away from her, and sets out to prove that she's the only one for him.\n\nWhen Renji Asou meets Chihiro Shindou at an abandoned train station, he doesn't notice anything unusual at first. But he soon discovers that she suffers from a rare form of amnesia and can only remember things for thirteen hours. Chihiro dreams of writing a novel, but her amnesia has made it an impossible task. Now, however, Renji is determined to help her fulfill her dream.\n\n[img]http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/9824/efmemories01.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/1964/efmemories02.jpg[/img]\n\nInfo:\n \nIMDb Link........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132203/\n aniDB Link.......: http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=5274\n ANN Link.........: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=8192\n Wiki Link........: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ef:_A_Fairy_Tale_of_the_Two.\n Other Link.......: http://www.ef-memo.com/\n \nGenre............: Drama / Psychological / Romance\n Distributor......: http://sentai-filmworks.com/\n Year.............: 2007\n Country..........: Japan\n Director.........: Shin Oonuma\n \nSource...........: Retail\n DVD Format.......: NTSC\n DVD Size.........: DVD9\n Programs Used....: DVD Decrypter\n Video Bitrate....: Varies\n Screen Format....: Widescreen\n Audio Language...: Japanese / English\n Audio Format.....: DD 2.0\n Subtitles........: English\n \nMenu.............: [x] Untouched\n Video............: [x] Untouched\n Audio............: [x] Untouched\n Extras...........: [x] Untouched\n \n\nContent:\n \nDisc 1\n \n-01 eve\n -02 upon a time\n -03 paradox\n -04 honesty\n -05 outline\n -06 rain\n \nDisc 2\n \n-07 l...\n -08 clear colour\n -09 forget me not\n -10 I'm here\n -11 ever forever\n -12 love\n \nExtras\n \n-trailers\n -clean opening and closing\n -credits\n \n\nHere's a recently release which some requested, so enjoy, please remember don't hit and run.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50b18e96d7b684e6cfec4cb51633dd9293595c81","amp;dn":"ef+-+a+tale+of+memories+%282007%29+R1+NTSC+2xDVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50b18e96d7b684e6cfec4cb51633dd9293595c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,177,142,150,215,182,132,230,207,236,76,181,22,51,221,146,147,89,92,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
