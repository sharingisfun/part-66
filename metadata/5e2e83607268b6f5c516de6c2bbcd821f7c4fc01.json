But Jake Tower has one final job for Kori - one chance to secure freedom for herself and her sister, Kenley - even if that means taking it from someone elseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe job? Recruit Ian Holt - or kill him. Ian's ability to manipulate the dark has drawn interest from every syndicate in the world; most notably, an invitation from Jake Tower. Though he has no interest in organised crime, Ian accepts the invite, because he's on a mission of his ownÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nIan has come to kill Tower's top Binder: Kori's little sister. Amid the tangle of lies, an unexpected thread of truth connecting Ian and Kori comes to light. But with opposing goals, they'll have to choose between love and libertyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nMy Missus enjoys, &amp; i hope u Enjoy\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e2e83607268b6f5c516de6c2bbcd821f7c4fc01","amp;dn":"Shadow+Bound+EBOOK++.mobi+%2B+.epub+NODRM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e2e83607268b6f5c516de6c2bbcd821f7c4fc01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,46,131,96,114,104,182,245,197,22,222,108,43,188,216,33,247,196,252,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
