When Snow White's beauty wins the heart of the prince that she desperately pursues, the Queen banishes her to the forest, where a ravenous man-eating beast hungrily awaits. Rescued by a band of diminutive highway robbers (the seven dwarves), Snow White grows into an indomitable young woman determined to take back her realm from the treacherous Queen.\n\n\n\n\nCast\n\nJulia Roberts as Queen Clementianna Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Roberts was the first to be cast, because very early on Tarsem Singh wanted an Evil Queen with whom audiences could relate. He stated that in the film, the queen is not evil, but rather insecure. He also revealed that the Queen's true ugliness may be revealed at the very end of the film.[3]\nLily Collins as Snow White Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Originally Saoirse Ronan was considered for the role of Snow White but the age difference between her and Armie Hammer was too large (he was 25 and she was 17). Felicity Jones was offered the part but turned it down.[4] Collins was eventually cast in the role.[5] Collins said in an interview that her casting happened in 24 hours after she met Tarsem Singh and read for him [6]\nArmie Hammer as Prince Andrew Alcott Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hammer was cast as the prince who is at first drawn towards the Queen and then towards Snow White. He beat out James McAvoy and Alex Pettyfer for the role.[7]\nNathan Lane as Brighton\nSean Bean as The King\nMare Winningham as Baker Margaret\nMichael Lerner as The Baron\nRobert Emms as Renbock\nMark Povinelli as Half-Pint\nDanny Woodburn as Grimm\nJordan Prentice as Napoleon\nRonald Lee Clark as Chuckles\nSebastian Saraceno as Wolf\nMartin Klebba as Butcher\nJoe Gnoffo as Grub\nBonnie Bentley as Caroline\nNadia Verrucci as Servant","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adb6f00a91a898bd5fcf64170c967cade087c543","amp;dn":"Mirror+Mirror++The+Untold+Adventures+of+Snow+White+2012+CAM+READ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adb6f00a91a898bd5fcf64170c967cade087c543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,182,240,10,145,168,152,189,95,207,100,23,12,150,124,173,224,135,197,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
