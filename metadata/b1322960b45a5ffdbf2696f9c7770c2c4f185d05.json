Overview\n2. System Requirements\n3. Installation and Using\n\n\n1. Overview\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBopup IM Client Software Development Kit (SDK) is a toolkit for Windows \nplatform that provides documentation, samples and COM components for \nbuilding powerful instant messaging functionality into existing \napplications, creating and developing a chat messenger software based \na client/server architecture. Applications built on this SDK interact \nand communicate with Bopup Communication Server (IM server software) \nthat must be installed as a server-side part of the instant messaging \nsystem. \n\nBopup IM Client SDK provides functions for connecting and establishing \nIM session with the communication server, sending/receiving personal \nand group instant messages, receiving urgent and high-priority tasks \nfrom the server, managing user's contacts, receiving presence status \nupdates within the Contact List. This SDK supports various \nauthentication methods to autorize users on the IM server: Simple, \nWindows Authentication (SSPI) and using Private login and password \ncredentials entered by a end-user. \n\nProvided functionality and supported features:\n\n* Secure and Private Communication\nAll transmitted messages are encrypted with strong encryption algorithms \nbased on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and CAST-128 algorithms. That \nis the first and primary way to make corporate and business IM safe and \nsecure. \n\n* Authentication Modes \nVarious modes to authenticate and authorize users with the IM server are \nsupported. Choose the best way for your corporate and business \ninfrastructure from the available authentication modes: Simple, Windows \nAuthentication (SSPI) and Private login/password. \n\n* Messaging Groups \nThe centralized management of user groups makes it possible to organize \na flexible IM structure with a list of assigned groups and send / \nreceive-only permissions set for each user. \n\n* User Presence Status \nSee the current status of each user in your Contact List, i.e. Online, \nAway, Offline (Not available). Manage your own status. \n\n* Contact List access \nOrganize your personal Contact List and access it from any workplace and \nlocation. \n\n* Offline and Urgent Messaging \nDeliver important information to users even if they are currently \nunavailable and receive such messages. Offline messages are stored on \nthe IM server and automatically delivered to the recipient when he goes \nonline. \n\n* Centralized Notification \nReceive notifications and urgent messages from the IM server and stay \nupdated on any events and information. These messages are automatically \nsent by the server on the scheduled time and at the specified intervals. \n\n* Message Logging &amp; Archiving \nBrowse, search and view the entire message archives on the IM server. \nPrint information for any period and for any person. \n\n\n\n2. System Requirements\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBopup IM Client SDK requires the following minimum system configuration: \n\n- 533 MHz processor (or higher recommended) \n- 64 MB RAM \n- 3 MB free disk space \n- Microsoft Windows 98/ME/NT 4.0/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7\n- A C/C++ compiler (Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or later) to build samples\n- Network configured for TCP/IP protocol \n- Internet connection (*)\n\n(*) - Internet connection is optional if the IM server running outside \na local area network (LAN).\n\n\n\n3. Installation and Using\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo install Bopup IM Client SDK: \n\n- Launch bopupsdk.exe or bopupsdk.msi setup file (*). \n- Follow all instructions in the Setup Wizard. \n- After installation you can launch this help file's shortcut from \n&quot;Start Menu -&gt; Programs -&gt; Bopup IM Client SDK&quot; folder. \n\n(*) - The filename may have a different name depending on custom \ninstallation package or supported platform. \n\n\nBopup IM Client SDK contents:\n\nInstallation folder of the SDK contains the following folders under the \nroot folder: \n\n&quot;\\&quot; - At the root level, the license agreement (license.txt), \ninformation file (readme.txt), contact information (contacts.txt) and \nthis help documentation file (BopupSDK.chm). \n\n&quot;\\com&quot; - Includes COM components and manifest files to build client \napplications. Files from this folder must be also redistributed with \napplications that use the SDK. \n\n&quot;\\include&quot; - Includes C++ header files that contain interface and \nstructure definitions. Must be included into client application's source \ncode of Bopup IM Client SDK. \n\n&quot;\\samples&quot; - Sample and tutorial C++ source code and Microsoft Visual \nC++ 6.0 build projects. \n\n\nRedistributable components:\n\nBopup IM Client SDK includes COM redistributable and manifest files that \nare required to run applications built using this SDK. The COM \ncomponents and manifest files are located in the \\com folder and must be \ndistributed and registered with the client application software on \na target computer. The components include: \n\n&quot;CSClient.dll&quot; - A core module which implements the IServerClient \ninterface that is used to communicate with the IM server. \n\n&quot;SecPrvdr.dll&quot; - An encryption module that is used by the IServerClient \ninterface for generating encryption session key with the IM server and \nfor encoding/decoding instant messages. This component is used by the \nIServerClient interface internally. \n\n&quot;CSClient.X.manifest&quot; - A manifest file for CSClient.dll module which \nadds a support for deployment of this COM component to a machine without \nthe need to register it. \n\n&quot;SecPrvdr.X.manifest&quot; - A manifest file for SecPrvdr.dll module which \nadds a support for deployment of this COM component to a machine without \nthe need to register it. \n\n\nRegistration of the COM components can be done via stardard COM \nregistration with the help of built-in regsvr32.exe Windows tool. Here \nis a sample of registration of the CSClient.dll and SecPrvdr.dll modules \nfrom a command line: \n\n&quot;regsvr32 csclient.dll&quot; \n&quot;regsvr32 secprvdr.dll&quot;\n \nFor more information on the regsvr32 registration tool run it with the \n/? command line parameter. \n\n\nThe COM components can be used without registration by enabling the \nRegistration-Free COM model. In that way the CSClient.X.manifest and \nSecPrvdr.X.manifest files must be also distributed with the client \napplication. These files should be copied into the same directory that \ncontains the application's executable and both CSClient.dll and \nSecPrvdr.dll components. Please note that it is required to create \na manifest file for application's executable too and the \nRegistration-Free COM mechanism is available in Windows XP/2003 and \nlater versions of Windows. \n\nFor more information on Registration-Free COM model please refer \ndocumentation available on Microsoft's website at Registration-Free \nActivation of COM Components: A Walkthrough &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973913.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973913.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n========================================================================\nCopyright (C) 2000-2012 B Labs.
