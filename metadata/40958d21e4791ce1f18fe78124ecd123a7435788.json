The anime DVDs for this arc call it &quot;Paradise Life on a Boat&quot;. This arc shows Naruto and his team on their journey to the Land of Lightning by sea, to confine him from Akatsuki during the Fourth Shinobi World War, as well as character development for the Konoha 11. Throughout the arc, small hints are given of what is to come in the anime such as a mention of a ninja clan talented in fÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«injutsu. The arc also expands on the character Aoba Yamashiro who will have a somewhat more prominent role in the upcoming arc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40958d21e4791ce1f18fe78124ecd123a7435788","amp;dn":"Shippuden+Season+11%5BSubbed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40958d21e4791ce1f18fe78124ecd123a7435788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,149,141,33,228,121,28,225,241,143,231,129,36,236,209,35,167,67,87,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
