No need to buy an expensive monitor. Sweet!\n\nAnyDVD HD is the &quot;must have&quot; utility for the serious home theater enthusiast using a media center / home theater PC.\n\nAnyDVD comes with its own UDF 2.5 file system, no need to install 3rd party UDF 2.5 driver under Windows XP. \n\nI downloaded the trial version and tried it with NOVA KILLER and all works fine. Just install anydvd, then run NOVA KILLER with admin priveleges and your done. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f67f0df2bcfbb041a2d60d5a73ae4c23b6bfcbb0","amp;dn":"AnyDVD+HD+7.0.2.0+and+Trial-Reset","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f67f0df2bcfbb041a2d60d5a73ae4c23b6bfcbb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,127,13,242,188,251,176,65,162,214,13,90,115,174,76,35,182,191,203,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
