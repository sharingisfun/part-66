How did the terrorist mastermind elude capture for nearly a decade, only to be discovered hiding in plain sight just yards away from PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most prestigious military academy? Peter Bergen, the famed journalist and author on Islamist terrorism who also produced bin LadenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first television interview, obtains rare access to interview former CIA agents, Navy SEAL operatives and a Black Hawk pilot who reveal how the U.S. gathered the intelligence needed to pull off the surprise attack. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll talk to White House and Pakistani intelligence officials as well as neighbors of the Pakistani compound and eyewitnesses to the raid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:176ce02655e3be2487f66e86f69b4240cf018ef9","amp;dn":"The.Last.Days.Of.Osama.Bin.Laden.SWESUB.HDTV.XviD-snuttebullen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"176ce02655e3be2487f66e86f69b4240cf018ef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,108,224,38,85,227,190,36,135,246,110,134,246,155,66,64,207,1,142,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
