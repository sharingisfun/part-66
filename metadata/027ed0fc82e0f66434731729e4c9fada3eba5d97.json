Joseph Goebbels, the head of the Nazi \n                   propaganda machine, personally commissioned The Titanic; he \n                   saw it as a potent weapon in demonizing the English. In his \n                   pursuit of creating what was to be the Third Reich's cinematic \n                   masterpiece he was ruthless. He had the first director \n                   murdered and poured in unrivalled resources even bringing \n                   troops back from the front to use as extras. The film was \n                   intended to show German valor and Allied weakness, but when it \n                   was finished it portrayed an entirely different message. It \n                   had become an allegory for Nazism itself. There was an all too \n                   apparent parallel of a country heading towards its own iceberg \n                   and sinking. The story of the Nazi Titanic had an unpleasant \n                   sting in its tail. The boat used to play the Titanic in the \n                   film, the Cap Arcona, was sunk by allied bombers with an even \n                   greater loss of life than the original ship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:027ed0fc82e0f66434731729e4c9fada3eba5d97","amp;dn":"Nazi.Titanic.2012.720p.HDTV.x264-DiVERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"027ed0fc82e0f66434731729e4c9fada3eba5d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,126,208,252,130,224,246,100,52,115,23,41,228,201,250,218,62,186,93,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
