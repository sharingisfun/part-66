By selecting appropriate lists of &quot;known bad&quot; computers, you can block communication with advertising or spyware oriented servers, computers monitoring your p2p activities, computers which have been &quot;hacked&quot;, even entire countries!  They can't get in to your computer, and your computer won't try to send them anything either.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nNOTE:\nPlease seed! After the torrent is done downloading, just leave it running in the background so others could have a chance to get the torrent as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee35c9f293cc555e47ab28d002ee3ebe69abd5a9","amp;dn":"PeerBlock+1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee35c9f293cc555e47ab28d002ee3ebe69abd5a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,53,201,242,147,204,85,94,71,171,40,208,2,238,62,190,105,171,213,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
