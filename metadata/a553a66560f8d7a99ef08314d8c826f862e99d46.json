Ranbirsingh, an independent administrator of Ajaygarh who refused to collect the taxes was imprisoned by king Amarsingh. Despite being coaxed by his wife Shakti, Ranbirsingh flouts the wishes of Amarsingh and pays for it with his life in the open court. . Strange are the ways of nature and stranger still the ways in which nature takes its revenge on human beings. Amarsingh gets a son but is warned by fortune-tellers that for eight long years neighter should he see his son nor his wife feed the baby, otherwise misfortune will befall him and the empire. Having no other alternative Amarsingh pursuades Shakti to look after the child. Shakti remonstrates with Amarsingh as he had killed her husband but ultimately she takes pity on the innocent baby and agrees to bring up Amarsinghs son Vijay and her own son Ajeet as twins. Time flies unseen and both Ajeet and Vijay grow up into handsome youngmen and are devoted to one another. The ill-fated time being over, Vijay is sent for by Amarsingh. . Unknown to Vijay, Ajeet had a sweetheart in his village by the name of Gouri. They were deeply in love with each other and their situation was an open secret.[/quote]\n\n[code]SOURCE...............................: DVD9\nLANGUAGE............................: HINDI\nSUBTITLES...........................: NONE\nIMDB...................................: BARA-DARI.
