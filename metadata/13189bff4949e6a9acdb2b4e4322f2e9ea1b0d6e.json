If you're finished hammering bird brains against the wall, go underground in the tap adventure game, City of Secrets. Requires logic and puzzle solving skills so turn your brain back on and prove you know your head from a Mole in the ground.\n\nEnter a brilliant high definition world of revolution, mystery, and adventure as you pull together the clues and solve puzzles to uncover the sinister plot. The hero's Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rex, the dog, and Mr. Moles - well of course - the mole, can't save Poco Pane without you.\n\nCity of Secrets is a classical point and click adventure game presented with beautiful hand drawn art, layered backgrounds and a 3D character cast, fully spoken throughout.\n\nOver 1 million games sold. Rex and Mr. Moles have been on adventures across Europe for many years and are making their debut globally on iOS. We love to entertain and are confident that Aidem Media is one palindrome you will instantly love.\n\nThe game can be tougher than your college entrance exam and it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t clear yet if you will need help from your friends or some little kid to solve the sinister plot.\n\nThere are several methods in the game to point players in the right direction such as a notebook containing a list of completed and 'to-do' tasks - and a hint system giving a written clue for the next most important task if you really get stuck.\n\nBetter than an IQ test, challenge your friends to see who can solve the sinister plot first. Good luck!\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.3\nLion compatibility fixes, rare Touch pad click problems fixed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13189bff4949e6a9acdb2b4e4322f2e9ea1b0d6e","amp;dn":"City+of+Secrets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13189bff4949e6a9acdb2b4e4322f2e9ea1b0d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,24,155,255,73,73,230,169,172,219,43,78,67,34,242,233,234,27,13,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
