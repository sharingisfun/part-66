Expelled from Rugby for drunkenness, and none too welcome at home after seducing his father's mistress, the young Flashman embarks on a military career with Lord Cardigan's Hussars. En route to Afghanistan, our hero hones his skills as a soldier, duellist, imposter, coward and amorist (mastering all 97 ways of Hindu love-making during a brief sojourn in Calcutta), before being pressed into reluctant service as a secret agent. His Afghan adventures culminate in a starring role in that great historic disaster, the Retreat from Kabul.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f7fd766b337c2c56db22c5390329500e161488","amp;dn":"Flashman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f7fd766b337c2c56db22c5390329500e161488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,247,253,118,107,51,124,44,86,219,34,197,57,3,41,80,14,22,20,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
