I caught it on a repeat.\n\n\nEpisode description:\nHow long does hope last? Presumed Dead tells the extraordinary stories of three ordinary Canadians who disappeared without a trace. It was supposed to be a romantic getaway, but Mark Comey and his wife Robyn's Mexican holiday turned to tragedy and mystery. One evening Mark headed down to the beach and just never came back. Was it death or deceit? Former Canadian Football League star Al Brenner vanished more than three decades ago. While police at the time suspected foul play, his family has always believed Brenner might have escaped into another life. The manhunt for missing 14-year-old Julie Bureau made headlines in Quebec for weeks before her trail went cold. For three years her grieving parents wondered what happened. Finding out the truth about Julie would be harder than losing her.\n\n\n\nShow description:\nCanadian television newsmagazine, airing on the English television network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Its primary focus is on investigative journalism, with some stories appearing on other American News shows. \n\n\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name        : the.fifth.estate.s36e11.presumed.dead.ws.dsr.xvid-cldd.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 1 142 Kbps\nLength            : 368 MiB for 45mn 4s 680ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 000 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6210099bf457257598ac3ac9e0c1579d6c738974","amp;dn":"the.fifth.estate.s36e11.presumed.dead.ws.dsr.xvid-cldd.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6210099bf457257598ac3ac9e0c1579d6c738974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,16,9,155,244,87,37,117,152,172,58,201,224,193,87,157,108,115,137,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
