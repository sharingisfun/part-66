In search of a new purpose for his life, Jimmy faces dark memories from his past as he tries to make peace with a world he once left behind. His life takes a transforming turn when he is involuntarily thrust back into the world of baseball. Not as a player, but as the coach of an underachieving college team struggling to rise above mediocrity. Coach JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rocky relationship with Brandon Elliot, the teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only star, forces both of them to deal with their similarly checkered pasts. One Hit from Home is a unique sports drama that explores the unpredictability of life and reminds us that we can find hope in the midst of broken dreams.\n\nGenre: Drama | Family | Sport\nIMDB rating: 5.6/10 from 16 users\nDirected by: Johnny Meier, David Aaron Stone\nStarring: Ronald D.
