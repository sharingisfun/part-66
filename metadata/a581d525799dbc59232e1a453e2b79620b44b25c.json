While it looks like a platform game, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a puzzle game at heart. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg in a level using a set number of tools. Players will have to look and plan ahead carefully while using items such as the Telewarp, Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢. Additional tools are gradually introduced as the player progresses through the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 80+ levels covering four unique worlds.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a581d525799dbc59232e1a453e2b79620b44b25c","amp;dn":"Toki+Tori+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a581d525799dbc59232e1a453e2b79620b44b25c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,129,213,37,121,157,188,89,35,46,26,69,62,43,121,98,11,68,178,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
