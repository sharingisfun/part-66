OverClocked ReMix today released its 33rd arrangement album, Mega Man X: Maverick Rising. It features sixty-two tracks from forty-nine artists. Directed by Wesley Ã¢â‚¬Å“BahamutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Cho with assistant directors Wes Ã¢â‚¬Å“EmunatorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ McDonald and Stevo Ã¢â‚¬Å“Level 99Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bortz, Maverick Rising is available for free download at http://maverick.ocremix.org.\n\nMaverick Rising features 4 Ã‚Â½ hours of music from a variety of genres with a hard rock and metal focus, and now ranks as OC ReMixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest arrangement project to date.

Maverick Rising is not affiliated or endorsed by Capcom; all original compositions are copyright their respective owners.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This album is meant to be a massive collaborative effort from members of the video game music arrangement community at large. I started this with the goal of covering the music of what appears to be a generally sparsely covered set of popular games, and to bring exposure to quality artists that many may not be aware of. I also wanted to see artists grow with their music,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explained director Wesley Cho. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am proud of what these musicians have accomplished on this album, and immensely thankful for all of those involved. I hope the album is just as enjoyable for the listeners as it was for those who worked on the music, artwork, video trailers, and website.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nForty-nine artists collaborated on musical tributes to the entire core series, including:\nMega Man X (SNES)\nMega Man X2 (SNES)\nMega Man X3 (SNES)\nMega Man X4 (PlayStation)\nMega Man X5 (PlayStation)\nMega Man X6 (PlayStation)\nMega Man X7 (PlayStation 2)\nMega Man X8 (PlayStation 2)\nMega Man Maverick Hunter X (PlayStation Portable)\nExclusively included in the torrent download are the 28 entries in OC ReMixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grand Maverick Remix Battle 2010 competition, organized by Shariq Ã¢â‚¬Å“DarkeSwordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ansari. The 2010 GRMB featured sixteen ReMixers, representing Maverick robots throughout the Mega Man X series, facing off and creatively combining the themes of two dueling Mavericks into unique arrangements.\n\nAbout OverClocked ReMix\n\nFounded in 1999, OverClocked ReMix is an organization dedicated to the appreciation and promotion of video game music as an art form.
