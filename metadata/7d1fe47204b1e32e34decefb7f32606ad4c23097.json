He loves telling tall tales and always brags about himself. According to him, he was picked up by a human couple who owns a diner while he was drifting around on an iceberg. \nThough he has lost all contact with his Canadian family, he has discovered a new home in serving the diners' clientele, thanks to the kind couple. His cafÃƒÂ© is an embodiment of his personality. The place is always packed with many regulars, animals and humans, who are drawn by his charismatic magnetism.\n\nRelease date : May 03, 2012\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\nStatus : Currently Airing\n\nProducers : Studio Pierrot\n\nGenres : Comedy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d1fe47204b1e32e34decefb7f32606ad4c23097","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Polar+Bear+Cafe+-+05+%5B480p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d1fe47204b1e32e34decefb7f32606ad4c23097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,31,228,114,4,177,227,46,52,222,206,251,127,50,96,106,212,194,48,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
