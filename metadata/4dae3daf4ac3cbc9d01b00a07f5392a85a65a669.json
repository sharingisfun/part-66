On their 8th anniversary, they invite several friends, chief amongst them Prabha and her husband, Ramesh; Revati, Gita, and an unexpected guest, a nephew of one their friend's, Rahul. Prabha gets very intoxicated during this get-together, and confides with Sandhya about her rocky marriage.

He does contact Sandhya again after about a year, this time to ask for a divorce. Again, Sandhya pleads with him to return, but he refuses. Then a year later, the estranged couple meet again, and this time it is Nikhil who wants to re-enter Sandhya's life, and this time it is he who is going to be shocked by her candid confessions!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dae3daf4ac3cbc9d01b00a07f5392a85a65a669","amp;dn":"drishti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dae3daf4ac3cbc9d01b00a07f5392a85a65a669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,174,61,175,74,195,203,201,208,27,0,160,127,83,146,168,90,101,166,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
