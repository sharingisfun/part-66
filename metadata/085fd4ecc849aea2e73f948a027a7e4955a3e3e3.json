Players spend one ingame &quot;week&quot; interacting with other characters, viewing scenes that advance the game's story, talking to their Servant in their room, and gathering clues to the identity of the enemy Servant. At the end of each day, they enter the Arena, a dungeon in which they can battle monsters to gain experience points and strengthen their Servant. Servants' stats are raised manually using skill points gained upon levelling up. At the end of each week is a decisive battle against the enemy Servant and Master, after which the player progresses to the next round of the tournament-style war.\n\nThe game's turn-based battle system is comparable to rock-paper-scissors -- &quot;Attack&quot; overpowers &quot;Break&quot;, Break overpowers &quot;Guard&quot;, and Guard overpowers Attack. During battle, both the player and the opponent line up six such moves at the beginning of each turn. Landing three successful hits allows use of an &quot;extra attack&quot; that cannot be countered. Most types of enemies have their own distinctive attack patterns, and memorizing these allows the player Servant to deal high amounts of damage while receiving minimal damage in return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:085fd4ecc849aea2e73f948a027a7e4955a3e3e3","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+FATE+EXTRA+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"085fd4ecc849aea2e73f948a027a7e4955a3e3e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,95,212,236,200,73,174,162,231,63,148,138,2,122,126,73,85,163,227,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
