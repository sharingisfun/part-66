Connery\\'s burglar takes her on suspiciously and demands rigorous training before their first job together--stealing a highly-valued mask from a chichi party. Their deepening attraction and distrust could tear apart their partnership but the promise of a bigger prize (some eight billion odd dollars) by Zeta-Jones keeps the game interesting. Only, who\\'s playing with whom?\n \n \nDirector: \nJon Amiel\n\n Writers: \nRonald Bass (story), Michael Hertzberg (story), and 2 more credits Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» \n\nStars:\n Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ving Rhames  \n\n\nenjoy and seed,please.\n\nBest regards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8639fc812056535fead71b5eb5f93d7278a9535e","amp;dn":"ENTRAPMENT.%281999%29.%28Jon.Amiel%29.DVD-Copy-%28MPEG2%5B%29%28%5DDolby-AC3+5.1%29-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8639fc812056535fead71b5eb5f93d7278a9535e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,57,252,129,32,86,83,95,234,215,27,94,181,249,61,114,120,169,83,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
