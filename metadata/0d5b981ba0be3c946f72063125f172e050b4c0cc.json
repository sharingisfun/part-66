It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where Ã¢â‚¬Ëœit doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel like the world I came fromÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease date       : April 15, 2012\n\n\nAudio language     : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language  : English\n\n\nGenres             : Action, Romance, Shoujo\n\n\nType               : TV\n\n\nEpisodes           : 26\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5b981ba0be3c946f72063125f172e050b4c0cc","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+03+%5B720p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5b981ba0be3c946f72063125f172e050b4c0cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,91,152,27,160,190,60,148,111,114,6,49,37,241,114,224,80,180,192,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
