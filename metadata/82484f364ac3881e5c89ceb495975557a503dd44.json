Copy &quot;Test Drive Unlimited 2 - Rip&quot; folder to path where you want to have game (instalation files dissappear after instalation)\n2. Run setup.bat, press ESC to close stupid animation and any key to continue\n3. It takes 15-20 to instal\n4. Run Test.Drive.Unlimited.2.Update.5.exe\n5. When it asked for path navigate &quot;Test Drive Unlimited 2 - Rip&quot; folder (it must install files inside this folder - the same folder as games files folder)\n6. Run UpLauncher.exe or desktop shortcut\n7. Let game patch (57 mb)\n8. When you will be able to click &quot;Play&quot; close this window\n\nNOW IMPORTANT \n\nEVERY TIME YOU WANT TO PLAY GAME DO:\n\n1. Copy TestDrive2.exe from &quot;old&quot; folder to game folder\n2. Run UpLauncher.exe or desktop shortcut\n3. Wait untill word &quot;Play&quot; will be in white color - don't close this window, don&quot;t click play\n4. Copy TestDrive2.exe and paul.dll from &quot;crack&quot; folder to game folder\n5. Now click play\n\nProof http://bayimg.com/fanBfaaDI\n\n****************************\nIf you have missed .dll or other problems make sure you have Visual C++,Direct,Physx,video card drivers up-to-date and of course system requirements.\n\n****************************\nTo download fast\n\nIf you are using mobile internet - forget to download fast - because of ping (yes it matters)\nIf you are using router first configure NAT/PAT - read uTorrent faq or forum and router manual\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82484f364ac3881e5c89ceb495975557a503dd44","amp;dn":"Test+Drive+Unlimited+2+Rip+%2B+DLC+%28seems+working%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82484f364ac3881e5c89ceb495975557a503dd44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,72,79,54,74,195,136,30,92,137,206,180,149,151,85,87,165,3,221,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
