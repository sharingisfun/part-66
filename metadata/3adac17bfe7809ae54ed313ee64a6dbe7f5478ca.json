Mad with power, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) has declared war against humanity. Amassing a bloodthirsty army of soldiers disfigured by his own hand, Hyperion has scorched Greece in search of the legendary Epirus Bow, a weapon of unimaginable power forged in the heavens by Ares. Only he who possesses this bow can unleash the Titans, who have been imprisoned deep within the walls of Mount Tartaros since the dawn of time and thirst for revenge. In the king's hands, the bow would rain destruction upon mankind and annihilate the Gods. But ancient law dictates the Gods must not intervene in man's conflict. They remain powerless to stop Hyperion...until a peasant named Theseus (Henry Cavill) comes forth as their only hope. Secretly chosen by Zeus, Theseus must save his people from Hyperion and his hordes... \n\n\nDirector:Tarsem Singh\nStars:          Henry Cavill, Mickey Rourke and John Hurt\nimdb: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1253864/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1253864/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/oo7zs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/oo7zs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/i9giv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/i9giv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/jNyoZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/jNyoZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/ZGqvS.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/ZGqvS.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n                                        TO VISIT MY facebook page to post requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR \n\n\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE THEN DO BUY THE ORIGINAL BLURAY/DVD\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3adac17bfe7809ae54ed313ee64a6dbe7f5478ca","amp;dn":"Immortals+%282011%29+720p+BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3adac17bfe7809ae54ed313ee64a6dbe7f5478ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,218,193,123,254,120,9,174,84,237,49,62,230,74,109,190,127,84,120,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
