As the neon is extinguished for another dawn, an aging gambler navigates the treacherous world of pimps, moneymen, and naive associates while plotting one last score - the heist of the Deauville casino. This underworld comedy of manners possesses all the formal beauty, finesse, and treacherous allure of green baize.\n\nFilm Essays - Bob le flambeur by Luc Sante: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/198-bob-le-flambeur&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/198-bob-le-flambeur&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de124868e4f2b8cff66e61e50c6e3dcbbdbf6207","amp;dn":"%5CBob+Le+Flambeur+%281956%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29+Criterion+Collection+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de124868e4f2b8cff66e61e50c6e3dcbbdbf6207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,18,72,104,228,242,184,207,246,110,97,229,12,110,61,203,189,191,98,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
