They were known for their fast-paced, upbeat blues and old-time music-influenced songs. Offering sometimes-bawdy good-time music, droll humor, and Lee Allen's delightful kazoo leads, they created a unique blues-derived sound independent from that of country music's star bluesman of the day, Jimmie Rodgers. Between 1926-1934 the &quot;Chattanooga Boys&quot; recorded 89 songs and notched several hits.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Sewanee, Tennessee and they both learned to sing and play musical instruments, Austin played the banjo while Lee concentrated on the guitar and kazoo. As they grew up they were influenced by local jazz and blues artists such as the guitarist and Mississippi river boat performer May Bell and the street singers the Two Poor Boys. By the early 1920s, they were performing in small coal-mining communities in the South doing medicine shows and Vaudeville onstage.\n\nThey received a recording contract on Columbia Records and recorded for the first time on April 7, 1927. At this first session they recorded &quot;Salty Dog Blues&quot; which became their first hit selling around 18.000 copies. Columbia, by mistake, placed one of their recordings in the &quot;race&quot; series (reserved for black artists) instead of its &quot;hillbilly&quot; series. The brothers threatened to bring a lawsuit against Columbia but in the end they decided to move to Victor Records instead. Working with the A&amp;R man Ralph Peer - who had been instrumental in bringing both Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family to fame - the Allen Brothers recorded their biggest hit &quot;A New Salty Dog&quot; in 1930. Due to the Great Depression, the brothers had to abandon their musical career in 1934. Although they were successful and sold more than other hillbilly groups - more than 250.000 copies altogether - they could not make a living from their music. Austin moved to New York and both brothers went to work in the construction business. \n\nIn the late '60s, The Allen Brothers were rediscovered by a new generation. Several LP reissues of their 78 rpm recordings appeared, and Lee Allen was coaxed into performing again. He appeared occasionally at local events near his home in Lebanon, TN, before his death in 1981. The 1990s saw the release of the brothers' complete recordings on three compact discs by Austria's Document label.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad73e3b723878dc22c18d244cde22d9bd5aa31c1","amp;dn":"Allen+Brothers+-+Complete+Works+Vol.1-3+1927-1934+%28Document%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad73e3b723878dc22c18d244cde22d9bd5aa31c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,115,227,183,35,135,141,194,44,24,210,68,205,226,45,155,213,170,49,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
