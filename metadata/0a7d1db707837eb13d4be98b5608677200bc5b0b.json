Like a rapture, the Powers are gone and humanity is left behind to pick up the pieces. Amongst this wreckage, two lovers, Evelyn and Gil, find themselves separated by a continent and will do anything to find each other again. But when a strange being named &quot;The Word&quot; turns Evelyn into a champion with an angelic spear, she finds the force of her love for Gil clashing with her newfound power. Love and destiny collide in what will become the worst breakup-ever.\n\nEveryone's been through a really bad breakup before, but what if yours happened right before the apocalypse? This is the scenario of The Rapture, a six issue miniseries by Michael Oeming and Taki Soma (You'll Never Die). The story is simple: boy (Gil) meets girl (Evelyn), boy loses girl, super-powered beings called Champions destroy civilization, girl gets super powers and tries to reunite with boy. While fending off cannibals.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a7d1db707837eb13d4be98b5608677200bc5b0b","amp;dn":"Rapture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a7d1db707837eb13d4be98b5608677200bc5b0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,125,29,183,7,131,126,177,61,75,233,139,86,8,103,114,0,188,91,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
