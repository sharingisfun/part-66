On March 9, 2007, a worldwide gateway opened and this interview was released.\n\nThe eyes4ears channel is truly blessed to be known as the international launch pad for the internet premier of Alex Collier's thought-provoking 1994 interview, even though back then we had to post it in 12 sections due to youtube limitations. Here it is, finally in full length now that youtube has changed those rules.\n\nAs the interview continues to be re-posted, the explosive content has developed a habit of creating spontaneous conversational hotbeds all over the world wide web. Viewers have made sharing their personal passionate thoughts and opinions on the film's sometimes controversial ideas a tradition that comes along with sharing this classic video.
