I believe his forecasts are accurate other than the timeline he presented in his book &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;. The Events he tells about are and will happen soon. He is Blue Collar too.\n\n\nHarold Lee &quot;Hal&quot; Lindsey (born 1929) is a controversial American evangelist and Christian writer. A graduate of the Dallas Theological Seminary, a prominent Christian Zionist and dispensationalist, he expresses this theology in his writings. He currently resides in the Palm Springs area of Southern California.\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas, Lindsey dropped out of the University of Houston to serve in the Korean War, then worked as a Mississippi River tugboat captain. His personal web site describes that when &quot;his first marriage broke up, he contemplated suicide, but instead found a Gideon New Testament and was converted. Lindsey became an avid reader of Scripture, particularly prophetic sections, which convinced him that the Bible was truly the Word of God.&quot;\n\nHe entered Dallas Theological Seminary in 1958 (with the help of &quot;Colonel&quot; Robert Thieme, pastor of Berachah Church in Houston, which Lindsey had attended) where he studied with John F. Walvoord, author of the 1974 best-seller Armageddon, Oil, and the Middle East Crisis. He graduated with a degree in theology. With his second wife Jan he worked with Campus Crusade for Christ and continued with them until 1969. Hal then helped a mission in Southern California which continued until 1976. During this period, in 1969, Hal wrote his first book, The Late Great Planet Earth.\n\nPublished in 1970 by Zondervan, The Late, Great Planet Earth became one of the best selling works of non-fiction in that decade. Coming on the heels of the Six-Day War, the book fueled the popularity of dispensational theology and its support of ethnic Jews as the &quot;chossen people of God&quot;. It has been published in 54 languages, has reported sales of over thirty-five million copies, and is still in print. Many of Lindsey's later writings are sequels or revisions and extensions of his first book.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was tortured and Murdered for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures.\n\nPraise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. With Repentance I Am Now forgiven for my sins past, present and Future.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&lt;/a&gt;             A place where Jesus would feel at home.
