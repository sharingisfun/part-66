What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 5 - Sunday - 19 contestants arrive at the MasterChef Kitchen for a flavour matching 'Mystery Box' challenge. With everyone eager to impress the judges, one contestant pushes himself too far and burns his hand. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbab42a8f3fd402523b2e417ad65679e77058fe7","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E25.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbab42a8f3fd402523b2e417ad65679e77058fe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,171,66,168,243,253,64,37,35,178,228,23,173,101,103,158,119,5,143,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
