The series follows key members of the London Underground's 19,000-strong staff, from CEO Howard Collins through to the litter pickers who clear miles of track every night. Drivers, station staff and emergency response workers reveal their unique perspective on the travelling public. Capturing the tube in all its guises, from tourist transport to suburban commute, or the last train home for partygoers, this series also looks behind the scenes of the tube's ten billion pound upgrade - and how the process of dragging a Victorian infrastructure kicking and screaming into the 21st century doesn't always run on rails.\n\n\n\n\n5)  Rush Hour \nRush hour is the Tube's biggest test - but it can be too much for some passengers. Station Supervisor Bob Weedon at Bank has to deal with five injuries and faintings in a row during one rush hour crush. Chief operating officer Howard Collins must muck in when a power failure on the Jubilee Line threatens to disrupt the evening peak. And the Tube's most unusual employee, a hawk called Toyah, is put to work on pigeon patrol.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/5512/thetubescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/5512/thetubescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/4428/thetubescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/4428/thetubescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img515/356/thetubescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img515/356/thetubescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/8860/thetubescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/8860/thetubescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img192/9601/thetubescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img192/9601/thetubescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img221/1166/thetubescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img221/1166/thetubescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/729/thetubescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/729/thetubescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img840/7403/thetubescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img840/7403/thetubescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/5968/thetubescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/5968/thetubescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img10/7405/thetubescreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img10/7405/thetubescreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img214/2452/thetubescreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img214/2452/thetubescreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img207/5940/thetubescreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img207/5940/thetubescreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1534 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:702 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.studentjournals.co.uk/culture/television/806-the-tube-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.studentjournals.co.uk/culture/television/806-the-tube-review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14f6cf8deb3e8500bf15fdda23f4fd2dc394bceb","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Tube+5of6+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14f6cf8deb3e8500bf15fdda23f4fd2dc394bceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,246,207,141,235,62,133,0,191,21,253,218,35,244,253,45,195,148,188,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
