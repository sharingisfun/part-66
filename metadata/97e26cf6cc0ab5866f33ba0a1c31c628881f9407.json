It uses lower resources than some of the other desktop managers, and has some beautiful themes available.\nUnity is a very nice linux distro imho which is why I chose it, and reasonably user friendly for new linux users, it has a helpful forum and irc chat channel if you need help, or just wish to introduce yourself, or make any comments.\nThe HUMANity x86_64 bit iso is similar to the i586 version, though has slightly newer e17 pkgs, (March 2012) and the newer kernel 3.2.9 the 64 bit version does not have the sys/sound though, it has a few more e17 themes, and features AgustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Angelic unity theme like the i586 version from February the apps are similar to the i586 version though not exactly the same.\n\nmd5sum : 0df4c1276c0b329635d7e818d07ca057  HUMANity64-Alpha-Unity-Cooker.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e26cf6cc0ab5866f33ba0a1c31c628881f9407","amp;dn":"HUMANity64-Alpha-Unity-Cooker.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e26cf6cc0ab5866f33ba0a1c31c628881f9407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,226,108,246,204,10,181,134,111,51,186,10,28,49,198,40,136,31,148,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
