This DVD appears unprotected and region code free for all applications and the Windows operating system as well. AnyDVD works in the background to automatically remove the copy protection of a DVD movie as soon as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inserted into the drive, allowing you then to backup the movie using a DVD backup tool such as CloneDVD and CloneDVD mobile. You can also remove the RPC region code, thereby making the movie region free and viewable on any DVD player and with any DVD player software. AnyDVD is capable of removing unwanted movie features, including subtitles and prohibition messages such as copyright and FBI warnings. It also allows you to launch an external application whenever you insert or remove a disc, or prevent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PC-friendlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ software from automatically launching when you insert a video DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64a4bceaffdaa0af16cb2c620739b1b77db837e2","amp;dn":"AnyDVD+%26amp%3B+AnyDVD+HD+7.0.0.0+Final","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64a4bceaffdaa0af16cb2c620739b1b77db837e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,164,188,234,255,218,160,175,22,203,44,98,7,57,177,183,125,184,55,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
