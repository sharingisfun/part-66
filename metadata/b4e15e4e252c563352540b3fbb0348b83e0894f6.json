Holcomb and Anna Mindess &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.treehousevideo.com/store/?main_page=page&amp;id=12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.treehousevideo.com/store/?main_page=page&amp;id=12&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhat is unique about this educational product?\n \nThank you for your interest in this DVD/workbook set.  A Sign of Respect focuses on \nhow deaf and hearing people can interact effectively. You may think it is easy to use this \nproduct by playing the DVD in class, having students sit back and watch the show for an \nhour to learn all about Deaf Culture.  While this may be the case for most educational \nDVDs, this product is different -- we designed it to be taken home and used for \nhomework, but not by just passively watching it. With this interactive DVD, students are \nexpected to participate in the learning process by picking correct solutions to various \nchoice points throughout the program.  Answers and explanations are provided to help \nstudents clearly understand expectations in the Deaf community.  In addition, a 92-page \nworkbook is included, which contains reading and writing assignments associated with \nthe scenes shown in the DVD.  The DVD/workbook set is a comprehensive curriculum \nwith readings, activities, homework assignments, journal questions, and will eliminate the \nneed for you to do as much planning and preparation, as it is all there and easy for you to \nuse.  \n \nWhat's the purpose of this DVD/Workbook? \n \nMany ASL and Deaf culture courses require students to attend Deaf community events.  \nStudents often report feelings of intimidation regarding such requirements, especially if \nthey have never met other Deaf people or have limited knowledge of the Deaf \ncommunity.  Furthermore, it is often difficult for instructors to provide support for due to \ntheir studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ limited fluency in ASL.  To address this challenge, this DVD/workbook \nset is designed to provide in-depth information on Deaf culture and the Deaf community \nin an accessible format (ASL, spoken English, and English captions).  It is hoped that \nstudents will become more comfortable and confident in attending Deaf community \nevents as well as meeting and interacting with Deaf people. In the end, this should help \nmake their experiences with both Deaf people and the Deaf community more positive.   \n\nWhich class is this DVD/workbook appropriate for? \n \nThis DVD/workbook set can be used with students at all levels, from Level 1 ASL \nclasses to advanced interpreting classes.  It is ideal for beginning ASL students as the \nentire content is accessible with information presented in both ASL and spoken English \nalong with English captions, reducing the need for awkward and superficial discussions \nin class due to limited fluency in ASL.  For advanced students, in-depth discussions can \nbe held on various relevant topics such as the places and roles hearing people can have in \nthe Deaf community, and the delicate nature of Deaf/hearing relationships.  In some \nlocations, Deaf community events are plentiful, affording students with many \nopportunities to experience Deaf culture up-close and process these experiences in class.  \nIn other areas, where the Deaf community is small with fewer opportunities for attending \nevents, this DVD can actually provide an alternative avenue to experience Deaf Culture.  \nSo, in this way, this DVD/workbook set is versatile enough to be used with all levels of \nclasses, depending on your goals and needs.   \n \nWhat is in the DVD? \n \nThis set contains a DVD and a workbook.  The storyline of the DVD follows an ASL \nstudent from her first day of class, where she learns of the requirement to attend Deaf \ncommunity events through her first participation in a Deaf community event, her first \nDeaf acquaintance and eventually her first Deaf friendship.  The journey is not entirely \nproblem-free for this student who repeatedly encounters cultural challenges. We \naccompany her as she faces 18 awkward situations, each followed by three possible \nsolutions, two of which are not considered as appropriate responses. Your students select \nwhat they believe to be the best solution for each situation and explanations are then \nprovided for each possible choice and as to reasons why this is or is not an accepted way \nto deal with things in the Deaf community.   \n \nWhat is in the Workbook? \n \nBecause A Sign of Respect DVD/workbook set is designed to function as supplementary \nlearning tool, each student needs to have his or her own DVD/workbook set to use at \nhome.  The numerous homework assignments contained in the set allow students to \nexplore and learn more about the Deaf community and Deaf culture.  The workbook \ncontains three sections.  In the first section, students are given opportunities to investigate \nthe history of Deaf community events, discover what Deaf community events are \navailable in their area, identify appropriate events to attend, and process feelings about \nattending a Deaf community function and meeting Deaf people.  The second section \nprovides information on how to use the DVD and allows students view it at home.  The \nthird section encourages students to develop relationships with Deaf people, become \ninvolved in the Deaf community and demonstrate respect to Deaf people and Deaf \nculture.   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e15e4e252c563352540b3fbb0348b83e0894f6","amp;dn":"A+Sign+of+Respect++Strategies+for+Effective+Deaf%2FHearing+Interac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e15e4e252c563352540b3fbb0348b83e0894f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,225,94,78,37,44,86,51,82,84,11,63,187,3,72,184,62,8,148,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
