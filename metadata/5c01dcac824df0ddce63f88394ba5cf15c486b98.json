After he gets word that Scotland Yard is investigating a $3,000,000 embezzlement he has committed, the imperious, mean-spirited Schaffner thinks he has sufficient time to take an inconspicuous train to Mexico where he can escape extradition. He miscalculates, and his crime has become headline news before he can cross the border. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport.\n\nThis is an untouched German DVD release with two audio tracks:\n\nTrack 1 - Deutsch (dubbed)\n\nTrack 2 - English (Original language)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c01dcac824df0ddce63f88394ba5cf15c486b98","amp;dn":"Across+the+Bridge+%281957%29+99+min.Rod+Steiger%2CCrime+Noir%2CDeutsch-E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c01dcac824df0ddce63f88394ba5cf15c486b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,1,220,172,130,77,240,221,206,99,248,131,148,186,92,241,92,72,107,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
