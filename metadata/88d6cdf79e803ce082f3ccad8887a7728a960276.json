At first it looks as if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in for some fun and lots of Southern snacks, but events soon turn scary when a real live vampire comes to life, bursts from his coffin and threatens all the townsfolk. On top of that, this baritone blood sucker seems intent on taking Daphne as his vampire bride! Could the vampire be a descendant of a famous vampire hunter who is trying to sell his book? Or perhaps heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the local politician, who has been trying to make his name in the press by attacking the vampires as downright unwholesome. The answers are to be found in a final song-filled showdown in the swamp in which our heroes unmask one of their most macabre monsters yet.\n\nGenre: Animation/Family\nRatings: IMDB 5.9/10\nDirected by: David Block\nStars: Jeff Bennett, Mindy Cohn and Jim Cummings\n\nRelease Name: Scooby.Doo.Music.Of.The.Vampire.2012.DVDRip.XviD-iGNiTiON\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: XviD, 624 x 352, 1162 kbps\nAudio: English MP3m 130 kbps\nRuntime: 78mns \n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d6cdf79e803ce082f3ccad8887a7728a960276","amp;dn":"Scooby+Doo+Music+Of+The+Vampire+2012+DVDRip+XviD-iGNiTiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d6cdf79e803ce082f3ccad8887a7728a960276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,214,205,247,158,128,60,224,130,243,204,173,136,135,167,114,138,150,2,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
