Users do not interact directly with these lower layers and are typically completelyunaware that they exist. Without a deliber-ate consideration of these threats, it is impossible to build effective security into the higher levels.\nSniffing is a passive security attack in which a machine separate from the intended destination reads data on a network. The term Ã¢â‚¬Å“sniffingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comes from the notion of Ã¢â‚¬Å“sniffing the etherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in an Ethernet network and is a bad pun on the two meanings of the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“ether.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Passive security attacks are those that do not alter the normal flow of data on a communication link or inject data into the link\nRead more at","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a4b47ebdd0df350477c4d885c736b65b28466d","amp;dn":"Hacking+-+Firewalls+And+Networks+How+To+Hack+Into+Remote+Compute","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a4b47ebdd0df350477c4d885c736b65b28466d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,164,180,126,189,208,223,53,4,119,196,216,133,199,54,182,91,40,70,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
