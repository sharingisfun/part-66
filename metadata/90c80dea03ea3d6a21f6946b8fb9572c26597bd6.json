A directorial debut for Korine, the film stars Jacob Reynolds, Jacob Sewell and Chloe Sevigny. Rather than following a linear plot, the film is a series of seemingly unrelated vignettes depicting the hopeless, nihilistic lives of the residents of Xenia, Ohio, a small Midwestern town that had been previously struck by a devastating tornado. The plot itself focuses on the impoverished people who dwell in the tornado's aftermath; however, it features no significant interconnection between each character and scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90c80dea03ea3d6a21f6946b8fb9572c26597bd6","amp;dn":"Gummo+%28Full+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90c80dea03ea3d6a21f6946b8fb9572c26597bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,200,13,234,3,234,61,106,33,246,148,107,143,185,87,44,38,89,123,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
