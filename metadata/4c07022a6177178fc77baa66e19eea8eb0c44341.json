Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.\n\n\nWhy another source code editor?\n*******************************\n\nThe company where I worked used JEXT (another open source code editor in Java) as the production tool. Due to its poor performance, I began an investigation to find another solution (in C++ instead of in Java) in September 2003. I found Scintilla and built a prototype. Unfortunately this solution was not accepted. I removed the specific part and continued to develop it in my leisure time. On the 25th November 2003 it was made available on Sourceforge, and that was the birth of Notepad++.\n\n\nHow to install:\n***************\n\nFrom the installer : \n\tJust follow the install wizard.\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.9.8 new features and fixed bugs:\n\n1.
