Whether it's proofs of client work, live sites that interest you, or screenshots of your favorite Mac applications, LittleSnapper allows you to capture, organize, annotate and share them all - from one beautiful OS X application.\n\nSnap Away\n\nWith LittleSnapper it's easy to start capturing webpages and your desktop. From entire webpages - including the bits that are out of view in a standard browser window and important metadata such as the web address - to specific windows on your Mac, LittleSnapper can handle it. The super-smart screen-capture engine you can capture your entire desktop - multiple displays included - and the powerful area and window-snapping tools make it super-simple to capture any area of the screen you require.\nJust to top it all off, there's a built-in web browser that allows you to select specific webpage elements, snap them on their own and save them to your library\n\nGet Organized\n\nKeeping your snaps organized is a breeze! LittleSnapper automatically categorizes your snaps based on their type - websnap or screen snap - meaning that even before you've applied tags you can quickly locate the webpage you snapped last week!\nAs well as auto-categorising snaps as you take them, LittleSnapper allows you to build your own collections - either using drag or drop, or building Smart Collections based on tags or other snap metadata such as URL. Want to see only 5-star, Red-tagged website or snaps taken Today? No problem! That's just two of the super-powerful, yet super-simple, rules you could set for a Smart Collection.\n\nCore Annotation\n\nWe know that you'll want to give feedback on snaps. Whether you're highlighting a UI element or simply wanting to point out a typo on your website to your over-typing copywriter, LittleSnapper's seven powerful annotation tools mean you'll always be able to give clear visual feedback.\n\nLittleSnapper packs a formidable annotation toolkit with blur, vector shapes, text annotations (complete with callouts if you want them), crop and the highlight tool that dims out all but the key areas of a snap at your fingertips.\n\nSystem Requirements; \nIntel Mac, LittleSnapper requires Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) or Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) and will not run on earlier versions of Mac OS X.\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aae46f456511dd2230bb99179bb76a00dc6a01c3","amp;dn":"Ltitle+Snapper+1.8.2+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aae46f456511dd2230bb99179bb76a00dc6a01c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,228,111,69,101,17,221,34,48,187,153,23,155,183,106,0,220,106,1,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
