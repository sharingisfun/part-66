Hackers and identity thieves are trying to use IP address to get any information out of you: home address, credit card information, social security information, your bank accounts and other personal information.\n\nActually, keeping your privacy is simple and easy. Use Hide IP Easy to hide your real IP with a fake one, surf anonymously, prevent hackers from monitoring your activity, and provide full encryption of your online activity, all with the click of a button.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*****Key Features*****\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Anonymous Web Surfing\n\nYou are assigned fake IP addresses and protected from hackers who will be tricked by your fake IP instead of your real one.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Protect Your Identity\n\nSurf anonymously to prevent websites, identity thieves or even government from compromising your computer, tracking your online activities, tracing your exact location or intercepting your private financial information.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Select Your Physical IP location\n\nYou decide fake IP of which country to use by choosing a country from the Choose IP Country window.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Send Anonymous E-mails\n\nHide your real IP in E-mail headers. Be protected while sending emails from Yahoo!, Hotmail, GMail.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Un-ban Yourself from Forums and Restricted Sites\n\nUse Hide IP Easy to change your IP address and access forums and restricted sites that have ever banned you.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*****How it works?*****\n\nYour computer is assigned an IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) when it connects to the Internet. An IP address is an Internet Protocol address, a unique identifying number. It is what enables you to do things like sending a message in a chat program to another computer, and out of all the millions of computers in the world, it arrives at the correct one.\n\nHowever, since it is used to identify all the different computers and websites on the Internet, it could be used to track your communications with all websites or programs that connect to the Internet. This is known as Direct Internet Connection.\n\nWhen you run Hide IP Easy on your computer, it will modify your Internet Connection Settings, telling your computer to make connections through a Fake IP Relay provided by Hide IP Easy instead of through Direct Internet Connection.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1. Install the program, and do not run.\n\n2. Copy the crack &quot;HideIPEasy.exe&quot; to prog dir, and replace the original.\n\n3. DONE!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOMMENTS ARE APPRECIATED\nKEEP SEEDING!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1667ba52cecad65738c3d755393e2c711dd71d","amp;dn":"Hide+IP+Easy+5.1.6.6+%2B+Crack%7E%7E%28TIMETHIEF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1667ba52cecad65738c3d755393e2c711dd71d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,22,103,186,82,206,202,214,87,56,195,215,85,57,62,44,113,29,215,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
