It is fast and can defrag a single file as well as multi-terabyte drives.\n\n* Registry Defrag\nDefragments and compacts the Windows Registry.

Track Eraser will protect your privacy by removing this confidential information from your computer.\n\n* Duplicate File Finder\nDaily computer activity inevitably leads to accumulating identical files on your computer.

Files you think you've deleted remain on the disk and can be easily restored with data recovery software. File Shredder was designed to permanently delete files, folders and the Recycle Bin contents, so your sensitive data cannot be restored. It provides four different shredding algorithms: from fast to military-level safety shredding.\n\n* Disk Wiper\nUnlike File Shredder, this tool wipes free space on an entire drive, making sure that files you have deleted previously can't be restored. To provide extra security, Disk Wiper allows turning off System Restore while wiping a disk. Since System Restore keeps track of file changes, turning it off ensures that no file copies will be created during wiping. In addition, this tool can wipe slack space and clear file entries from the file system table.\n\n* Startup Manager\nLists all the programs that start automatically on Windows boot or when you log on to your PC.

Service Manager will help you to identify and disable unnecessary services by providing comprehensive descriptions and recommendations for each running service.\n\n* Task Manager\n\nThe program lets you track all running applications and processes. It displays CPU, RAM and disk usage by individual program or process, as well as total consumption of system recourses. If there are processes believed to be dangerous, Task Manager will warn you about them, so you can easily end the task and check it on the Internet. It also allows you to speed up any process you want by setting higher priority of system resources usage for the selected process.\n\n* System Information\nThis tool provides comprehensive and easy to understand information about your computer.
