Blade and Makoto meet a shaman named Agus who states that if they attack the Existence settlement, the Existence were harmed the village. Agus tells them that the Existence enslaved his village. At Agus' house, Blade and Makoto find that Agus' wife Yati was turned into a vampire. Agus states that he has been immersing Yati in a sacred water until he can find a cure for her. Agus stated that he made enough water for the other women that were converted into vampires. Blade states that there hasn't been a cure for vampires. Blade leaves as Makoto wonders if it will work. Later that night, Blade and Makoto encounter Lucius Isaac who states that he should focus his aggression towards his real enemy. Blade ends up fighting Lucius who states that Agus won't be able to cure him. Lucius then states a comment about how Blade killed his own mother. Makoto joins the fight and Lucius knocks her into a tree. Lucius leaves stating to Blade that he should keep his eyes on the prize. The next day, Blade tells Makoto that vampires get stronger by age. Blade starts to wonder if Agus was right about a cure for vampires. Blade mentions that he has been hunting vampires since he was young. Makoto then tells Blade that it's time to hunt some vampires. At Agus' house, Agus finds that Yati is gone. At the silver mines, Blade and Makoto free the slaves as Agus catches up stating that Yati has gone missing. Agus has Blade give him his word not to kill Yati. Blade states that there is no curing people of theri vampire side. As night falls, Yati emerges and she constricts Agus. Agus tries to reason with her only for Yati to bite him and Blade to retaliate by slaying her. More women vampire emerge with Makoto and Razor fight them while Blade looks for Dracon Frost. Agus admits that he failed to save his wife as more female vampires emerge. Agus tells Makoto to lead them to the lake. Blade encounters a vampire who states that Deacon Frost has left for Madripoor five days ago. \nThe vampire assumes a rat-like appearance with the ability to split into many rats. With the female vampires in the water, Agus activates the water's effects which destroys the vampires. Blade manages to use his Phantom Move to slay the vampire.
