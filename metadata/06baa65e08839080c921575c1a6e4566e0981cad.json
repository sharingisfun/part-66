I recently caught it on a repeat.\n\n\nEpisode description:\nThe personal toll of tragedy: Canadian stories of Haiti's earthquake.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2010, Air Canada Flight 950 delivered 195 passengers from Montreal to Port au Prince, Haiti as it did each week. But on this day the businesspeople, expatriates and development workers were landing two-and-a-half hours before a devastating earthquake that literally ripped this tiny troubled nation apart. \n\nThe stories of those on board Ã¢â‚¬â€ many of whom knew one another from frequent trips taken on the same flight Ã¢â‚¬â€ offer a unique and engrossing window through which we witness the tragedy that struck Haiti and still reverberates in Canada. Some of those on board were killed instantly in the quake. Some were injured. Others were conscripted into the daunting crisis that overwhelmed the country Ã¢â‚¬â€ and overwhelms it still.\n\nAfter the Earth Shook follows the struggles of four people with a special relationship to the country. A Haitian-Canadian entrepreneur, haunted by a murder that made him flee Haiti, is conflicted about recommitting to a country he considers more dangerous than ever. An eye surgeon who watched cherished colleagues crushed to death attempts to rebuild a hospital reduced to rubble that terrible day. A development worker finds the seed for positive change in a land traumatized by disaster and disease. And finally, an urban planner from Montreal tries to help the reconstruction of Haiti, but is turned away by a country more in need than ever.\n\n\n\nShow description:\nCanadian television newsmagazine, airing on the English television network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
