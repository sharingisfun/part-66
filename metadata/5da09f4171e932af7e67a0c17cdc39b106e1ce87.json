ÃƒÆ’Ã‹â€  considerato il 9Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âº classico Disney secondo il canone ufficiale.\n\nIl film ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ diviso in due parti:\n\nNella prima parte, il Grillo Parlante appare sotto la forma di un presentatore che incita il pubblico all'ottimismo nonostante la grave situazione storica (la Guerra Fredda e la minaccia atomica). Si trova in una casa sconosciuta, e, rincorso da un gatto, raggiunge un orsacchiotto di peluche ed una bambola, che appaiono tristi. Incitandoli a stare su con il morale il grillo mette sul grammofono un disco a 78 giri di Dinah Shore che narra la storia di Bongo, un orsacchiotto ciclista-acrobata, che lascia il circo e si rifugia nel bosco dove s'innamora di un'orsacchiotta di nome Lulubelle. Dopo le prima difficoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  ad adattarsi alla vita nel bosco e lo scontro con un grosso orso malvagio invaghitosi della sua amata, riuscirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  a coronare il suo sogno d'amore.\nNella seconda, intitolata &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot; (&quot;Topolino e il fagiolo magico&quot;), Topolino, Paperino e Pippo, come nella fiaba di Jack e il fagiolo magico, raggiungono, arrampicandosi su di una pianta di fagiolo, il regno delle nuvole, dove si trova il castello di un gigante. La fiaba ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ narrata da Edgar Bergen in una sequenza live-action: il ventriloquo, assieme ai suoi pupazzi Charlie McCarthy e Mortimer Snerd, narra la storia all'attrice bambina Luana Patten durante la sua festa di compleanno (il grillo li raggiunge dopo aver trovato l'invito su una scrivania). Quest'ultimo segmento ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ stato poi riproposto separato nel 1963 con Pico De Paperis come narratore.\n\n\n\nFun and Fancy Free is a 1947 animated feature produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures on September 27, 1947. It was one of the &quot;package films&quot; (feature-length compilations of shorter segments) that the studio produced in the 1940s. It is the ninth animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, and the fifth package film by Disney.\nThe &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot; portion of the film was the last time Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse as he was too busy working on other projects to continue voicing the famous character. Disney replaced himself with sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald.\n\nThis film features two segments, Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk. Jiminy Cricket first appeared inside a large plant in a large house, exploring it and singing &quot;I'm a Happy-Go-Lucky Fellow&quot; until he happened to stumble upon a doll, a teddy bear, a record player, and some records, and set it up to play the story of Bongo.\n\nBongo\n\nThis segment is based on an original story by Sinclair Lewis, following a circus bear cub who wishes to live free in the wild. Bongo escapes and soon realizes through his adventure that he must prove himself in order to earn his freedom. He also forms a romantic relationship with a female bear cub in the wild.\nBongo is narrated by Dinah Shore. However in the re-release of Bongo, Cliff Edwards (as Jiminy Cricket) narrated the story.\n\nMickey and the Beanstalk\n\nThis segment is an adaptation of Jack and the Beanstalk with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy as peasants who discovered temperamental Willie the Giant's castle in the sky through the use of some magic beans.\nMickey and the Beanstalk was narrated by Edgar Bergen in live-action sequences, who, with the help of his ventriloquist's puppets Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd, told the tale to child actress Luana Patten at her birthday party.\nMickey, Donald and Goofy lived in a place called &quot;Happy Valley&quot;, which was plagued by a severe drought, after a golden harp who sang to make people happy, was stolen from a nearby castle in Happy Valley. The residents had nothing to eat except one loaf of bread; in a memorable scene the bread was cut into paper-thin slices. After Donald attempted to kill their cow with an axe, Mickey traded in their beloved animal for magic beans. Donald threw the beans in a fit of rage, and they fell through a hole in the floor. That night, the beanstalk sprouted and it carried their house upward as it grew. Climbing the gigantic beanstalk they entered a magical kingdom of equal scope, and entering the castle, Mickey, Donald and Goofy helped themselves to a sumptuous feast. This roused the ire of Willie the Giant, who is able to transform himself into anything. When they were spotted by Willie, Mickey spotted a fly-swatter and asked Willie to demonstrate his powers, by turning into a fly. Willie initially suggested turning into a pink bunny, but when he agreed to their request, he turned into a pink bunny anyway, and spotted Mickey, Donald and Goofy with the fly-swatter. Enraged, Willie captured Mickey, Donald, and Goofy and locked them in a box. Mickey however escaped. It was up to Mickey to find the key and rescue them, with the help of the singing golden harp. Once freed, the hapless heroes returned the golden harp to her rightful place and Happy Valley to its former glory, killing the giant by chopping down the beanstalk.\n\n\nDirected by Jack Kinney (animation)\nBill Roberts (animation)\nHamilton Luske (animation)\nWilliam Morgan (live-action)\nProduced by Walt Disney\nWritten by Homer Brightman\nEldon Dedini\nLance Nolley\nTom Oreb\nHarry Reeves\nTed Sears\nSinclair Lewis (original author of Bongo)\nStarring Cliff Edwards\nEdgar Bergen\nLuana Patten\nWalt Disney\nClarence Nash\nPinto Colvig\nBilly Gilbert\nAnita Gordon\nDinah Shore\nStudio Walt Disney Productions\nDistributed by RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.\nRelease date(s) September 27, 1947\nRunning time 73 minutes\nCountry United States\n\n\nBookmark and Share \t\n\n\nBongo e i tre avventurieri ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ un film d'animazione di Walt Disney distribuito dalla RKO Radio Pictures nelle sale americane il 27 settembre 1947.
