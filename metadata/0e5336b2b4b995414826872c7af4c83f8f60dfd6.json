In response, the leader of Konohagakure's ninja military ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Fourth Hokage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the newborn Naruto Uzumaki. Konohagakure, however, regarded Naruto as if he were the demon fox itself and mistreated him throughout most of his childhood. A decree made by the current Kage, the Third Hokage, forbade anyone mention the attack of the demon fox to anyone else. This included Naruto, who was not aware of the demon inside of him. Years later, Naruto is tricked by the renegade ninja Mizuki into stealing a forbidden scroll that would teach him a secret ninja technique, but he is stopped by his teacher, Iruka Umino. When Iruka almost dies while protecting Naruto from Mizuki, who also reveals that he is the container of the Nine-Tailed Fox, Naruto uses the Jutsu he learned from the scroll that creates multiple clones of himself, Shadow Clone Technique, to defeat Mizuki.\nNaruto is assigned alongside, Sasuke Uchiha, who he competes against often, and Sakura Haruno, by Iruka after his class graduate from the Ninja Academy to form a three-person team named Team 7 under an experienced and severe sensei named Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 is charged with completing missions requested by villagers, such as doing chores or being bodyguards. After several missions, Kakashi allows Team 7 to participate into a ninja exam in which they can advance to a higher rank, and thus, take part in more difficult missions. During the exams, Orochimaru, a criminal at the top of Konohagakure's most wanted list, attacks Konoha and kills the Third Hokage in an act of revenge. This forces one of the three legendary ninja, Jiraiya to search for his former teammate Tsunade, who has been nominated to become the Fifth Hokage. During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru desires to acquire Sasuke due to his powerful genetic heritage. Believing Orochimaru will be able to give him the strength needed to kill his brother Itachi, who destroyed his clan, Sasuke joins him. Tsunade sends a group of ninja including Naruto to make Sasuke return to Konoha, but Naruto is unable to defeat him and bring him back to the village. Naruto does not give up on Sasuke, however, and he leaves Konoha to train for two-and-a-half years under Jiraiya's tutelage in order to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke.\nAfter the training period, a criminal organization called Akatsuki attempts to capture the nine powerful tailed beasts that are sealed within people - including the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox sealed inside of Naruto. Several ninjas from Konohagakure, including Team 7, fight against the Akatsuki members and search for their teammate Sasuke. Although they manage to save Gaara, the host of the One-Tailed beast, Akatsuki is successful in capturing seven of the creatures. In the meantime, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke is told by the Akatsuki founder Madara Uchiha that Itachi was ordered by Konohagakure's leadership to destroy his clan. Saddened with this revelation, Sasuke joins forces with Akatsuki to kill Konohagakure's superior who ordered the Uchihas' elimination.\nMeanwhile, as several Akatsuki members are defeated by the Konohagakure ninjas, their leader, Pain, invades the village to capture Naruto. However, Naruto defeats him and convinces him to abandon the village. With Pain's eventual death, Madara announces that he wants to obtain all nine of the tailed beasts in order to perform an illusion powerful enough to control all of humanity. All the leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to aid him, and instead, join forces to confront him and his allies. This results into a fourth ninja world war between the unified armies of the Five Great Countries collectively known as the &quot;Ninja Alliance Army&quot; and Akatsuki's forces.\n\n\nRelease date      : February 23, 2012\n\nAudio language    : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\nGenres            : action, comedy, drama, fantasy, tournament\n\nThemes            : dark side, developing powers, ninja\n\n\n&quot;This verified torrent was uploaded to Torlock.com.&quot;\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nComplete name                            : [HorribleSubs] Naruto Shippuuden - 251 [1080p].mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFile size                                : 529 MiB\nDuration                                 : 23mn 9s\nOverall bit rate                         : 3 195 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;efa7868887afa3dbc1df&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 23mn 9s\nNominal bit rate                         : 3 072 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                                   : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 23.810 fps\nOriginal frame rate                      : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 23mn 9s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : Yes\n\n\n\nIf you have problems with playback, update your video codecs or codec packs.\n(CCCP/FFDshow Tryouts/CoreAVC/whatever else people use).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e5336b2b4b995414826872c7af4c83f8f60dfd6","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Naruto+Shippuuden+-+251+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e5336b2b4b995414826872c7af4c83f8f60dfd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,83,54,178,180,185,149,65,72,38,135,44,122,244,200,63,143,96,223,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
