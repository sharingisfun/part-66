Our lady sleuth sashays through the back lanes    \n  and jazz clubs of Melbourne, fighting injustice with her              \n  pearl-handled pistol and her dagger sharp wit.                        \n                                                                        \n  After many years abroad, Phryne returns to Melbourne, in part to      \n  start a new life in her home town, but to also ensure that Murdoch    \n  Foyle (Nicholas Bell), the man thought to be responsible for her      \n  younger sisters mysterious disappearance, never gets out of jail.    \n  But before her very proper Aunt Prudence (Miriam Margolyes), a        \n  well-known society matriarch, can drag Phryne off to attend her       \n  first soiree, Phryne finds herself embroiled in a murder.             \n                                                                        \n  She befriends the most unlikely of murder suspects  an innocent      \n  Catholic girl, Dot Williams (Ashleigh Cummings). Phryne takes Dot     \n  under her wing, employing her as a maid. Over time, Dot becomes one   \n  of Phrynes closest companions; with Dots natural intelligence in    \n  all things domestic and catholic she is often an unexpected asset in  \n  Phrynes murder investigations. From illegal abortions to union       \n  disputes, exploited workers and missing girls, Phryne finds justice   \n  for those who cant help themselves.                                  \n                                                                        \n  As she delves deeper into the murky world of murder, Phryne crosses   \n  paths with the local constabulary, befriending the handsome           \n  Detective Inspector Jack Robinson (Nathan Page). Despite being        \n  married, Jack finds himself drawn to Phrynes vibrant personality     \n  and seeks to ensure that she is kept out of harms way as they        \n  endeavour to solve the cases.                                         \n                                                                        \n  They come to rely on each other, Jack for the information he gets     \n  through diligent police procedures, and Phryne for the information    \n  she obtains using her charms and daring. When Jack wont give Phryne  \n  the information she needs, she can easily manipulate Jacks trusting  \n  deputy, Constable Hugh Collins (Hugo Johnstone-Burt), to keep her     \n  informed even if he is not aware he is doing so. Leaving a trail of   \n  admirers in her wake, our heroine makes sure she enjoys every moment  \n  of her lucky life and along the way she unlocks the truth of her own  \n  dark history.                                                         \n                                                                        \n  The Honourable Miss Phryne Fisher began life in 1989 as the daring    \n  lady detective protagonist of a series of 18 crime books written by   \n  Australian author, Kerry Greenwood. With an acquired taste for the    \n  best, but impeccable working-class origins, Phryne was an instant     \n  success with readers and still shows no sign of hanging up her        \n  pearl-handled pistol or giving up her adventurous love-life for     \n  just one man.                                                         \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.abc.net.au/tv/phrynefisher/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.abc.net.au/tv/phrynefisher/&lt;/a&gt;                                \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5b2c6f3d38293e2c1b3c363a323775383436&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b285836e3f8f1cd900b61aa96ccd11d38cdd0df5","amp;dn":"Miss.Fishers.Murder.Mysteries.S01E01.WS.PDTV.x264-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b285836e3f8f1cd900b61aa96ccd11d38cdd0df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,133,131,110,63,143,28,217,0,182,26,169,108,205,17,211,140,221,13,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
