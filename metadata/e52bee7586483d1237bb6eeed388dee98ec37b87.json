And yet, above the cries of horror, one hears a unified voice, an eternal proclamation, the determined singing of those in a growing line of martyrs.\n\nWithin The Mark - Audio Movies, you will hear the jubilation of those who meet God for the first time, and the steadfast resolve of those about to me Him face to face. The world is told to make a stand one way or the other, and you have a front row seat. \n\nGenre: Futuristic\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Gap DIGITAL &amp; Tyndale House Publishing\nDramatized radio adaptation\nFormat: MP3,\nBit rate: 128kbps mp3 format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e52bee7586483d1237bb6eeed388dee98ec37b87","amp;dn":"08+-+The+Mark+by+Tim+LaHaye%2C+Jerry+B.+Jenkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e52bee7586483d1237bb6eeed388dee98ec37b87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,43,238,117,134,72,61,18,55,187,110,238,211,136,222,233,142,195,123,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
