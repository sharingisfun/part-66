The documentary was broadcast by most 348 PBS affiliate stations on April 17, 2006.\nBecause of the controversial nature of the subject in Turkey, PBS attempted to give both sides a voice and produced a four expert panel discussion to be aired immediately afterwards. However, due to an intense lobbying effort by Armenian groups and some members of Congress, the follow-up panel discussion was cancelled on a third of those stations broadcasting the documentary over concerns of offending human rights groups and the descendants of Armenian Genocide survivors.[1]\nProduced in conjunction with Oregon Public Broadcasting, it was written and directed by Andrew Goldberg (who also directed The Armenians: A Story of Survival) and narrated by Hollywood celebrities Orlando Bloom, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Jared Leto, Julianna Margulies and Natalie Portman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f2e40dda6534882c07e5631422cba75bcd7202e","amp;dn":"Genocidio+Armenio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f2e40dda6534882c07e5631422cba75bcd7202e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,46,64,221,166,83,72,130,192,126,86,49,66,44,186,117,188,215,32,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
