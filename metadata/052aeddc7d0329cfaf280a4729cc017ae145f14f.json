But they are really the worst culprits themselves, having double morals in doing an even worse thing themselves.\n\nUK high court has decided that TPB is &quot;massively infringing on copyright&quot;. The facts that no copyright is being infringed upon here at the site was not a welcome fact, so that was ignored apparantly.\n\nAs usual there are easy ways to circumvent the block. Use a VPN service to be anonymous and get an uncensored internet access, you should do this anyhow. Or use TOR, I2P or some other darknet with access to the internets. Change your DNS settings with OpenDNS. Or use googles DNS servers... we could go on...\n\nThe Pirate Bay has released their own modified CGIPROXY software so anyone with access to a webserver or desktop PC can easily start their own Pirate Bay proxy. The software can be found here on this torrent (includes readme file). If enough people set these up, Your country will have to reconsider their blocking policies. \n\n\nP.S. Don't forget that we can't allow this shit to happen. Next time they're coming for something else. And yes, there will be a next time if we don't stop them. Write to your ISP and tell them to appeal the case. Write to your local MPs and tell them that this is not allowed. Make sure your voice is heard. Remember, we're all the pirate bay, and we must stand united against the censorship from our opponents!\n\nWith Love, Stun\n\nTwitter @TPB_Stun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:052aeddc7d0329cfaf280a4729cc017ae145f14f","amp;dn":"TPB%27s+CGI-PROXY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"052aeddc7d0329cfaf280a4729cc017ae145f14f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,42,237,220,125,3,41,207,175,40,10,71,41,204,1,122,225,69,241,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
