His obsession was to classify, encode and unify books and documents published all over the world. Over the years, he and his staff would fill in 12 million index cards. His classification system is regarded today as similar to hypertext, which enables us to navigate the internet.\n\nA pacifist and an internationalist, Otlet was one of the driving forcesbehind the League of Nations. He persuaded the architect Le Corbusier to design a World City dedicated to Peace, Knowledge and Fraternity. This beautiful film interweaves a vast fund of recently discovered documents from his archive with autobiographical material to create a fascinating piece of intellectual history.\n\nQuote:\nFile Name: The.Man.Who.Wanted.to.Classify.the.World.2002.DVDRip.XviD.avi\nFile Size (in bytes): 1,002,129,408\nDuration (hh:mm:ss): 1:00:31\n\nVideo Codec Name: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Count: 90752\nFrame Width (pixels): 640\nFrame Height (pixels): 480\nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;: 1.333\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 1786\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame: 0.233&quot;\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz): 48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps): 133\nAudio Bitrate Type: VBR\nAudio Channel Count: 2\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz): 48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps): 132\nAudio Bitrate Type: VBR\nAudio Channel Count: 2\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz): 48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps): 131\nAudio Bitrate Type: VBR\nAudio Channel Count: 2\n\n\n3 AUDIO TRACKS : ENGLISH / FRENCH / DUTCH\nENGLISH, FRENCH &amp; DUTCH SUBTITLES","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6fe0666feccb0cc9375a1266361b7816d907cf3","amp;dn":"The+Man+Who+Wanted+To+Classify+The+World+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6fe0666feccb0cc9375a1266361b7816d907cf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,254,6,102,254,204,176,204,147,117,161,38,99,97,183,129,109,144,124,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
