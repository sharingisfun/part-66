An insightful opportunity to witness the facts behind such tragic air disasters as the Tenerife 1977 and New York 2001. Aircrash Disasters investigates both high-profile and little-known air disasters. We uncover how and why they happened, viewers are taken on board flights in trouble, recreating the tension and pressure in the cockpit and cabin. \n\nEvents depicted here are based on cockpit voice recorders, flight data information and accident reports. News footage, interviews with key witnesses, and CGI is also used to shed light on causes behind disasters.\n\n\n1)  The Tenerife Air Disaster \nThe Tenerife Air Disaster - Most Deadly, Discovery Channel 43 Mins\n\nOn March 27th, 1977 in the beautiful Canary Istands of Spain, the worse disaster in aviation history to date took place. In an attempt to take off in a thick fog, a 747 collides with another on the runway in Tenerife. The fiery explosion kills 583 people leaving just 70 survivors.\n\nBy using forensic re-creations and transcripts of the recorded cockpit and control tower conversation, this programme investigates exactly what went wrong. We interview the ony surviving pilot Captain Robert Bragg, and two of the stewardesses working on one of the planes that day as they take us though the events and their experiences. We hear from numerous experts, authors and pilots as we try to unravel the events leading up to the incredible disaster.\n\nThis type of collision is referred to as a runway incursion and, shockingly, we Iearn that we are far from protected from another Tenerife taking place again.\n\nProduced and Directed by Phil Desjardins\nNarrated by Jim Forbes\nExecutive Producer - Erik Nelson\nExecutive Producer for DNE - Eugene Vink\nDiscovery Communications, LLC.\n\n2)  Pan Am Flight 103 \nPan Am 103 - Minute By Minute, The History Channel 45 Mins\n\nOn the evening of December 2lst, 1988, Pan Am FIight 103 mysteriously exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland.

Inside is an ordinary cassette recorder, but tucked inside the recorder is a &quot;Semtex&quot; explosive. The bomb detonates and all is lost. An investigation is immediately launched, and a thumb-sized timing devise eventually Ieads officials to the two men responsible for the deaths of 270 people\n\nThis programme relives the disaster at Lockerbie through the recollections of those involved and tells the story of the extensive investigation which resulted in the eventual trial of two Libyan men 11 years later.\n\nProduced and Directed by Lisa Shaughnessy\nNarrated by Peter Demeo\nExecutive Producer - Jonathan Towers\nProduced by Tower Productions, Inc. for A&amp;E Network\n\n3)  TWA Flight 800 \nTWA Flight 800 - Best Evidence, Discovery Channel 43 Mins\n\nIn 1996, TWA flight 800 exploded shortly after take-off from New York's JFK Airport instantly killing all 230 peopIe on board. The scale of the disaster was enormous and wreckage was scattered all over the ocean. The families left behind needed to know exactly what had happened.\n\nThere were three possibilities; mechanical failure, a bomb inside the hold or a missile from the outside. It became obvious that the explosion occurred inside the centre fuel tank, but what nobody knew, was the cause.\n\nAfter 12 months of the largest and most expensive airplane investigation to date, the FBI &amp; NTSB revealed their verdict on the crash. They believed the fuel in the central tank had vapourised while the pane waited on the hot tarmac. A sprk then ignited the vapours causing an enormous explosion.\n\nHowever, there is much speculation about the government's spark theory. Over 150 eyewitnesses claim they saw a rocket or missie strike the plane. Radar evidence and traces of plastic exposives found in the wreckage further added to the speculation.\n\nThis programme speaks to all those involved in solving the mystery as weII as key eyewitnesses and aviation experts in order to understand exactly what happened on that fateful day.\n\nProduced by Phil Desjardins\nWritten and Directed by Jeff Vanerwal\nNarrated by Shawn Devlin\nExecutive Producer - Erik Nelson\nExecutive Producer for DNE - Eugene Vink\nDiscovery Communications, LLC.\n\n4)  Last Hour of Flight 11 \nLast Hour Of Flight 11 - Zero Hour, Discovery Channel 47 Mins\n\nOn 11th September 2001, the world watched in horror as two hijacked American Airlines planes were flown into The Twin Towers, devastating the lives of thousands.

Experience the pulse-pounding countdown from the moment that the passengers boarded Fiight 11 to the split second before the plane hit the Twin Tower.\n\nThat evening, FBI agents found two black cases belonging to Mohammed Atta that had failed to be put on Flight 11 in time for its departure. Within these cases were videos of pilots' tours, a hand-held flight computer, a Koran and five sheets of Arabic script detailing Atta's plan of action for that day.\n\nThis programme uses Atta's chilling prescription for death in voice over as the minutes unfold from the perspectives of various key people invoived; the terrorists on the aircraft; the hostesses making their telephone calls to the ground and ground control at Logan airport.\n\nWritten, Produced and Directed by - David Hickman\nNarrated by David Morrissey\nExecutive Producer - Dan Korn and Andre Barro\nExecutive Producer for DNE - Susie Worster ; Bettina Hatami\nDiscovery Communications, LLC.\n\n5)  Fear of Flying \nFear of Flying - Extreme Machines, Discovery Channel 43 Mins\n\nWhen the going gets tough at 30,000 feet and the unexpected happens, it's only the pilots with 'the right stuff' who wilI bring you safely down to earth.\n\nWatch incredible footage of Captain Larry Fuda landing his Boeing on only one set of main landing gear. Captain Eric Moody lost all four engines when he flew into a cloud of volcanic ash. After gliding for an agonizing 14 minutes and dropping 25,000 feet, the engines suddenly burst into life.
