This is ONLY the CD. The book is kind of useless; it does give you some tips on how to use Photoshop, but you could find that info and more for free on the internet.\n\nSidenote: Tested on Windows 7 and Mac. Works flawlessly.\n\nAbout: The program is basically a character maker. There's a &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Upper Body&quot; and &quot;Lower Body&quot; section. You may choose from a dropdown text list or open the thumbnail viewer for each section. The program automatically attaches the clip-art. There is also a &quot;Lucky Dip&quot; function which is a randomizer and the results are usually silly. And once you're done there's a Copy button, so you can paste it into Paint/Photoshop/Whatever, and a Print button, so you can print it out and color it and put it on your fridge if you want. There's also a Quit button, not quite sure what it's for.\n\nDirections (Windows):\nMount the CD with Daemon or PowerISO. Alternatively, you can burn it to a physical CD.\nRun the autoplay.\nFollow the on screen instructions.\nEnjoy, lol ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f05ffcfef0e9b365039c5f501ba8025423294b7","amp;dn":"OMMC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f05ffcfef0e9b365039c5f501ba8025423294b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,5,255,207,239,14,155,54,80,57,197,245,1,186,128,37,66,50,148,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
