You can disable all components within MGSE to get a pure Gnome 3 experience, or you can enable all of them to get a Gnome 3 desktop that is similar to what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been using before. Of course you can also pick and only enable the components you like to design your own desktop.\n\nThe main features in MGSE are:\n\n    The bottom panel\n    The application menu\n    The window list\n    A task-centric desktop (i.e. you switch between windows, not applications)\n    Visible system tray icons\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75398b40b4ccf460fe9a79679fb1fb558676ebfe","amp;dn":"linuxmint-12-lxde-cd-32bit+-+Magik_420.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75398b40b4ccf460fe9a79679fb1fb558676ebfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,57,139,64,180,204,244,96,254,154,121,103,159,177,251,85,134,118,235,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
