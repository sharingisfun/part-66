Born James Ramey in Richmond, IN, in 1944, Baby Huey was literally an enormous stage presence: a glandular problem kept his weight around 350-400 pounds and beyond. He began performing in Chicago clubs in 1963 with his backing band the Babysitters and soon became a popular concert draw. As the '60s wore on, Baby Huey's sound moved from energetic R&amp;B into a more psychedelic brand of soul, with a vocal style that drew comparisons to Otis Redding. He signed with Curtom and recorded a debut album, The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend, that featured several Curtis Mayfield songs (most notably the oft-sampled &quot;Hard Times&quot; and &quot;Mighty Mighty Children&quot;), plus a cover of Sam Cooke's &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come.&quot;\n\n(font: allmusic)\n\n320 kbps\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42e24962cf7622582bbeff5e142eff3eec56a933","amp;dn":"Baby+Huey+-+The+Living+Legend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42e24962cf7622582bbeff5e142eff3eec56a933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,226,73,98,207,118,34,88,43,190,255,94,20,46,255,62,236,86,169,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
