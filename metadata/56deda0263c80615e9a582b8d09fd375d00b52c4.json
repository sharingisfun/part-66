In celebrating her Diamond Jubilee, Elizabeth II emulates her great-great-grandmother Victoria Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and, together, these two queens have clocked up more than twice as many years on the throne as the four kings who came between them. But all isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite as it seems.\n\nModern monarchs donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rule: they reign. When Elizabeth II puts on the Imperial State Crown to open Parliament, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the words of her government that she speaks, not her own. To find a much-travelled great-grandmother ruling England (as the kingdom governed from London then was) we have to go back more than eight centuries, to the extraordinary Eleanor of Aquitaine, queen of both France and England.\n\n\nShe Wolves - Englands Early Queens - S01 - E01 - Matilda And Eleanor\nShe Wolves - Englands Early Queens - S01 - E02 - Isabella And Margaret\nShe Wolves - Englands Early Queens - S01 - E03 - Jane, Mary And Elizabeth\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 59mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 531 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 59mn 6s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 112 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56deda0263c80615e9a582b8d09fd375d00b52c4","amp;dn":"BBC+-+She+Wolves+-+Englands+Early+Queens+-+S01+-+TVrip+-+Xvid+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56deda0263c80615e9a582b8d09fd375d00b52c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,222,218,2,99,200,6,21,233,165,130,184,208,159,211,117,208,11,82,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
