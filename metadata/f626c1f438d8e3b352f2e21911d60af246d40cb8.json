Players alternate turns moving Egyptian-themed pieces having two, one or no mirrored surfaces. All four types of pieces (pharaoh, anubis, pyramid and scarab) can either move one square forward, back, left, right, or diagonal, or stay in the same square and rotate by a quarter twist. Each turn ends by firing the real laser diode built into each player's Sphinx piece. The laser beam bounces from mirror to mirror; if the beam strikes a non-mirrored surface on any piece, it is immediately removed from play. The ultimate goal is to illuminate your opponent's pharaoh, while shielding yours from harm!\n\nThe Khet Rules: http://www.khet.com/rules.htm\n\nYou can buy the Real Khet at http://www.khet.com/store/index.html\n\nFEATURES:\n* Artificial Intelligence Engine by Don Dailey (developer of KOMODO world's leading Chess Program).\n* 2 PLAYER mode to battle among friends to show them WHO OWNS THE GAME!!\n* Thrilling difficulty levels like NOOB, ANUBIS GUARD , PHARAOH and KHET MASTER to provide perfect challenge.
