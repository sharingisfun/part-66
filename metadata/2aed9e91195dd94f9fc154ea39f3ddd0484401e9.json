Will be up and running flawless by the next update. Important: Epic bot 520 is the older normal Epic bot, and the plain Epic Bot is the PRO version, I will be updating this daily with new features and scripts so please stay tuned/\n\n* Simba scripts can be found here: http://villavu.com/ *\n\nDisclaimer\n***********************************************************************************\n\nThis is a compilation of all of the most functional RuneScape macros and bots as of April 12, 2012. I have included instructions on how each bot is to be set up for best performance &amp; results.\n\nI take no credibility for any development of the bots featured in my compilation. I did however, include every script that I have personally purchased up to this date. The scripts that I have purchased can be found in the RSBot folder, as RSBot is the client that the paid scripts will work for.\nUPDATE: I will re-include the scripts when they are functional. RSBot is currently in its beta stage of development, rendering all scripts nonfunctional.\n\nThe bots featured in my compilation are as follows:\n\nRSBot\nEpicBot\nSimba\n\nUpon the completion of your download, please make sure to seed, and leave feedback for how I can make future improvements to it's organization/addition of more paid scripts/etc.\n\nThank you &amp; stay tuned, as I will be making consistent releases to keep up with the flow of bot &amp; script updates. Please bookmark my profile to be notified of my releases!\n\n- Epidemic\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aed9e91195dd94f9fc154ea39f3ddd0484401e9","amp;dn":"Runescape+Macros+%26amp%3B+Bots%5BEpic+Bot+PRO%5D+%5BApril+16th%2C2012%5D%5BEpid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aed9e91195dd94f9fc154ea39f3ddd0484401e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,237,158,145,25,93,217,79,159,193,84,234,57,243,221,208,72,68,1,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
