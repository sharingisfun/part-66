These files are constructed to be computer, digital television, and portable device friendly.  These will not play with iPods or iPads until VLC or another player is available for them (again)...  Somebody else is already making them specifically for iPod use.  Sorry if that is what you are looking for.\n     These are also aimed at being of a reasonable size.  If you really want files that are a gigabyte or so in size, you might as well just wait for the official blu-ray release.  And seriously, unless you are using raw 5.1 or higher sound, there is no absolutely no reason you should be anywhere near a gig, even for 1080p.\n\n     The idea here is to periodically update this torrent until it contains all 26 episodes of the second season.  This will be done inconsistently, and may not be completed at all.  It has been difficult to obtain the episodes to start with, and several sources were so badly encoded, I didn't have the tools to correct the problems, and had to grab another source.  So, every so often this torrent will disappear to be replaced by one with more episodes.  By launching the new torrent pointed at the files you have already downloaded, will keep your files seeded without losing any ratio, and it will just add the new files.  You may wish to lock/protect the previous videos just in case your client has a hiccup.  Duplicating the files as a backup is an alternative to prevent disasters.\n\n     This encode job is a favor for my friend and her husband, and like other jobs for my anime club, is being upped here in the spirit of sharing work with others.  So be kind, but please comment and/or rate the material.  I do take constructive criticism well, and it does help future endeavors.\n\n\n01   Broadcast 09-17-2011   The Return of Harmony - Part 1\n02   Broadcast 09-24-2011   The Return of Harmony - Part 2\n03   Broadcast 10-15-2011   Lesson Zero\n04   Broadcast 10-22-2011   Luna Eclipsed\n05   Broadcast 11-05-2011   Sisterhooves Social\n06   Broadcast 11-12-2011   The Cutie Pox\n07   Broadcast 11-19-2011   May the Best Pet Win!\n08   Broadcast 11-26-2011   The Mysterious Mare Do Well\n09   Broadcast 12-03-2011   Sweet and Elite\n\n10   Broadcast 12-10-2011   Secret of My Excess\n11   Broadcast 12-17-2011   Hearth's Warming Day\n12   Broadcast 01-07-2011   Family Appreciation Day\n13   Broadcast 01-14-2011   Baby Cakes\n14   Broadcast 01-21-2011   The Last Roundup\n15   Broadcast 01-28-2011   The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000\n16   Broadcast 02-04-2011   Read it and Weep\n17   Broadcast 02-11-2011   Hearts and Hooves Day\n18   Broadcast 02-18-2011   A Friend in Deed\n\nAnd this collection includes a couple of extras that my friend Cindy stumbled upon in her pony searches.
