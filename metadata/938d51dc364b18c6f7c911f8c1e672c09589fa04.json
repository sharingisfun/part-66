This demo does not contain full gameplay functionality that will be in the final release such as dockable capital ships, dynamic economy, player influence system or any of the final canon star systems.\nIn the demo, there are two systems where all of your interaction will take place: the combat prototype system and the capital prototype system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:938d51dc364b18c6f7c911f8c1e672c09589fa04","amp;dn":"Freeworlds%3A+Tides+of+War+Demo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"938d51dc364b18c6f7c911f8c1e672c09589fa04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,141,81,220,54,75,24,198,247,201,17,248,193,230,114,192,149,137,250,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
