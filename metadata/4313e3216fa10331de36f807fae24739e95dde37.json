Time to Have Fun!&quot;&quot;\n\n\n\nPersona 4 takes place in a rural town named Inaba. There have been mysterious murders occurring whenever there was fog after heavy rain. There were also rumors about a channel on television airing only at midnight called Mayonaka TV, during which it is said that one can see his/her &quot;other half&quot; when staring at the TV screen. \n\nAfter hearing about a recent unsolved murder which occurred during the fog, the charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Narukami, Chie, and YosukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½discuss how each of them had attempted to watch the mysterious TV channel and witnessed the murder victim. The protagonist later realizes that during midnight when the channel is on, his body can phase into his television set as a gateway to enter another world infested with shadows. \n\nAfter discovering this, they all decide to explore. When first completely entering the world, dazed and confused, Narukami meets Teddie. Mayonaka TV and the town murders seem to have a connection. The murder victims may be merely victims of Mayonaka TV. Everyone decides that they will together try to solve the mysterious murders by exploring the hidden world of Mayonaka TV\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus                 : On-Going\n\nRelease date           : February 16, 2012\n\nAudio language         : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language      : English\n\nGenres                 : comedy, drama, fantasy, horror, mystery\n\nThemes                 : parallel world, Split Persona, sub-conscious feelings\n\n\n\n&quot;This verified torrent was uploaded to Torlock.com.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nComplete name                            : [CuzWeCan-TAN(unconsciously)]_Persona_4_The_Animation_-_19_[720p].mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFile size                                : 456 MiB\nDuration                                 : 24mn 17s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 624 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4a02232d220a067e647a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nMuxing mode                              : Header stripping\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 24mn 17s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nMaximum bit rate                         : 7 995 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nStandard                                 : NTSC\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 24mn 17s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\n\n\nIf you have problems with playback, update your video codecs or codec packs.\n(CCCP/FFDshow Tryouts/CoreAVC/whatever else people use).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4313e3216fa10331de36f807fae24739e95dde37","amp;dn":"Persona+4+The+Animation+19+%5BCuzWeCan-TAN%28unconsciously%29%5D%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4313e3216fa10331de36f807fae24739e95dde37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,19,227,33,111,161,3,49,222,54,248,7,250,226,71,57,233,93,222,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
