We have been told that the band were re-named by their manager as Phantom, and we know that the line-up which recorded Divine Comedy definitely came from Rochester, a small town about 30 miles from Detroit.\n\nOn both albums the vocalist sounds like Jim Morrison and indeed Capitol Records issued a statement that it was leading to legal action by Elektra.\nWhat of the music? Divine Comedy is highly rated by many, it has a mystical sound and is recommended. Tales From A Wizard and Welcome To Hell, which are both rather melodramatic, are arguably the strongest tracks but a consistent standard is maintained throughout.\nThe Divine Comedy line-up made a second self-titled LP in 1978 under the name Happy Dragon Band (Fiddlers 11 57) 1978, This is more electronic.\nThe Lost Album contains previously unreleased material. Musically it's similar to their first effort though not as good.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Tales From A Wizard 5:34\n02 - Devil's Child 2:34\n03 - Calm Before The Storm 3:38\n04 - Half A Life 4:17\n05 - Spideres Will Dance (On Your Face Will You Sleep) 4:22\n06 - Black Magic/White Magic 3:36\n07 - Merlin 5:37\n08 - Stand Beside My Fire 5:44\n09 - Welcome To Hell 5:11\n\nBand:\nPhantom - vocals,guitars,piano\nX - drums &amp; percussion\nY &amp; W - bass\nZ - piano &amp; organ\nPhantom - bag piano, bag guitar\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed72ba7b833264b2f552dac9fcbcc21b8d5b659f","amp;dn":"Phantom%27s+Divine+Comedy+-+Part+1+%281974%2F1993%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed72ba7b833264b2f552dac9fcbcc21b8d5b659f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,114,186,123,131,50,100,178,245,82,218,201,252,188,194,27,141,91,101,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
