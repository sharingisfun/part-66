What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 5 - Monday - The contestants arrive in Tasmania for a market stall competition, where they are divided into four teams. The teams must run their own take away market stall and create their own unique dish. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c71bededda56cb31a5be623e1a76eede78c1ab","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E26.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c71bededda56cb31a5be623e1a76eede78c1ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,199,27,237,237,218,86,203,49,165,190,98,62,26,118,238,222,120,193,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
