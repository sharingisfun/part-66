It was released on Xbox Live Arcade at March 7, 2012 and will be released on the PlayStation Network in spring.[5] The developers released the official release date for the Xbox 360 version via Facebook as March 7, 2012.[6]\n\nThe game takes place in the fictional American city of Haventon, one year after the Event, a worldwide cataclysmic event that wiped out most of the human civilization and left the world in ruins and barely habitable, with the ground now covered by a toxic cloud of dust and ash. I Am Alive focuses on facing the permanent insecurity of a now decaying and hazardous world, and humanity's darkest inclinations.\n\nOriginally under development by Darkworks from 2008 until 2010, Ubisoft Shanghai has since worked on the title.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:280ff9aba5f438d19db4f15fe5d167bb067d3eb2","amp;dn":"XBLA+I+Am+Alive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"280ff9aba5f438d19db4f15fe5d167bb067d3eb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,15,249,171,165,244,56,209,157,180,241,95,229,209,103,187,6,125,62,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
