I just want to reconcile humans with this class that has a lot of class - insects !&quot;.\n\nWhoever meets Georges Brossard and listens to him plead the cause of insects leaves the encounter with a new vision of the world. Needless to say, Georges Brossard himself is &quot;quite a specimen&quot;. After fifteen years as a notary, at age 38, he left his old life behind to scour the world in search of insects. With great tenacity, he succeeded in putting together one of the world's largest private collection of insects. Brossard wanted to donate his treasure to Quebecers, but on one condition: that a world-class temple be built and dedicated to the study of insects. Thus was born the Montreal Insectarium. Since then, Georges Brossard has become a world-famous authority on establishing insectariums and popularizing entomology, the study of insects, including a mandate from the Audubon Organization to develop a $55 million insectarium in New Orleans.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/3044/insectia2screen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/3044/insectia2screen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XVID\n * Video Bitrate: 3943 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720x1280 (height x width)\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 9x16 (1:1,78)\n * Audio Codec: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3) \n * Audio BitRate: 384 kbps\n * Audio Streams: 1\n * RunTime Per Part: 22 min 31,38 s (40501 Frames)\n * Part Size: 698,82 MB\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4a6ed60112ba1d25e0088858a6af2f9b2914928","amp;dn":"Insectia2+Life+in+a+Single+Tree+HR+DivX6+AC3+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4a6ed60112ba1d25e0088858a6af2f9b2914928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,166,237,96,17,43,161,210,94,0,136,133,138,106,242,249,178,145,73,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
