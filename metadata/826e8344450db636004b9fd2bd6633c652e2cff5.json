Duck thinks this will be the perfect present for Frog, and tries to lasso one out of the sky for him. Try as he might, Duck is unable to catch a star for Frog, and cries himself to sleep. But while he sleeps, someone leaves him a wonderful present: the letters S-T-A-R. &quot;A Christmas Present for Dog&quot; - It's Christmas morning, and all the WordFriends are excited by the presents Santa has brought for them! Pig has a sled, Bear has a doll, and Ant has a cookie. But not all the letters for Dog's present came down his chimney. All he has is a B-A-L. Bear gets filled with the Christmas spirit and makes a sacrifice to ensure Dog's Christmas will be merry.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826e8344450db636004b9fd2bd6633c652e2cff5","amp;dn":"4-WordWorld-Happy+Holiday%27s+WordFriends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826e8344450db636004b9fd2bd6633c652e2cff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,110,131,68,69,13,182,54,0,75,159,210,189,102,51,198,82,226,207,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
