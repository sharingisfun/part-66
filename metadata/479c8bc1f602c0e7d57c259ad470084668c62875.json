He knows that the next league fixture, against leaders Real Madrid, will be much more difficult than people seem to think and therefore Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll playing what I think is the strongest team and that can adapt best to the opponent and the groundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Although he has a crucial Champions League semi final against Chelsea to worry about in addition to the clÃƒÂ¡sico, he is not even contemplating the idea of resting any of his stars. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult but we want to extend our league challenge and to do that we have to play the best team we can Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ if the difference was ten points we could make one competition a priority, but given the situation we are in, the game with Levante is more importantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn La Liga, he believes it is essential for his team to stay within at least four points of the lead. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t win the game against Levante, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have nothing to play for against MadridÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We would lose the little chance we have Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ There is only one way to extend competitions, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s by winningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nResolution: 720 x 480\nSound : Stereo.
