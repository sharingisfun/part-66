It has been described as, &quot;three parts Bull Durham, two parts Slap Shot, add a dose of Bingo Long and a pinch of The Longest Yard&quot;. It has also been described as, the best baseball movie most of you never saw. The book, The baseball filmography, 1915 through 2001, described Long Gone as one of the most thoroughly enjoyable baseball comedies made in the last two decades. Robert Creamer, a writer for Sports Illustrated, wrote that it was probably the best made-for-television movie he has ever seen. John O'Connor, a writer for The New York Times, wrote that Long Gone makes classics like The Pride of the Yankees look like promotional fantasies. The Bleacher Report wrote that this film deserves to be included in anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collection of baseball features. Newsday called it one of the best sports movies ever made. Long Gone was ranked 50th in the book, The Ultimate Book of Sports Movies: Featuring the 100 Greatest Sports Films. It also rated a mention in the book, The great baseball films, which stated Long Gone was an above average comedy-drama that is full of bite, grit, and good feelings. Despite the positive reviews, Long Gone has been largely overlooked by mainstream media and remains extremely difficult to buy on DVD.\n\nDirected by \tMartin Davidson\nProduced by \tJoan Barnett\nScreenplay by \tMichael Norell\nBased on \tLong Gone by\n\t\tPaul Hemphill\nStarring \tWilliam Petersen\n\t\tVirginia Madsen\n\t\tDermot Mulroney\n\t\tLarry Riley\n\t\tKaty Boyer\nDistributed by \tHBO\nRelease date(s) 1987\nRunning time \t113 minutes\nLanguage \tEnglish\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40fad838e356f06cca10b38b71a4110a305d28d2","amp;dn":"LongGone%281987%29%28baseball%29.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40fad838e356f06cca10b38b71a4110a305d28d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,250,216,56,227,86,240,108,202,16,179,139,113,164,17,10,48,93,40,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
