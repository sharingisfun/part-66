In simpler terms: whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s good for the individual man or woman is not necessarily, or very often, good for a prosperous society. This has been a core concept here at the Chateau since its inception.\n\nAnd so a great truth about humanity is revealed that liberals mostly, and conservatives to a lesser degree, have trouble wrapping their brains around.\n\n...\n\nChew on that. Realize what is being said here. If you do, you should feel a shudder descend your spine. Individualism and freedom of thought are the enemies of the very values and morality which gave birth to them and elevated them to primacy among advanced nations.\n\nWhat libertarian, conservative OR liberal could read and accept the above premise and not feel at least some elemental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ some PRIMAL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ part of his worldview shatter into a million pieces. Libertarians: laissez faire means the cementing of intractable human hereditary differences into antagonistic classes and milieus. Conservatives: freedom and prosperity mean a slackening of external behavioral motivators and the erosion of commonality and shared values and the means with which to argue for them. Liberals: nonjudgmental individualism means a collapse of social capital and a surrender of any moral or aesthetic authority.[/quote]\n\nc)  Wall Street Journal - Mystification and Triumphalism, Why the left can't handle the truth about social conservatism: \n\n[quote][b]In other words, less affluent Americans are socially conservative because they bear the brunt of the social policies and cultural attitudes that prevail among affluent liberal elites.[/b] You can see why it would be difficult for Krugman and Alter, who doubtless pride themselves on their compassion and moral rectitude, to acknowledge or even consider this explanation. They need to be obtuse as a psychological defense.\n\n...\n\n&quot;That [the 1960s progressivism] was an understandable thing for them [liberals like Paul Krugman and Jonathan Alter] to believe given the times and what one assumes were their predispositions. [b]But while feminism and the sexual revolution have been great for high-status men like Krugman and Alter (full disclosure: and this columnist), and for those women who place a high value on professional careers, things have not worked out so well for those who are less privileged.[/b][/quote]\n\n-----\n\n[b]ABOUT THE SHOW[/b]\n\n[img]http://i797.photobucket.com/albums/yy254/solo2550/the-agenda-with-steve-paikin.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]TVO - The Agenda with Steve Paikin[/b]\n\n[i]The Agenda with Steve Paikin[/i] is TVO's flagship current affairs program - devoted to exploring the social, political, cultural and economic issues that are changing our world, at home and abroad.
