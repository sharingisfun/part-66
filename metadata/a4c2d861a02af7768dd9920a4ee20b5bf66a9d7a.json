However, this unique browser isn't designed for browsing websites. \nIt's designed for playing RuneScape in and, as a result, is full of RuneScape specific utilities, bookmarks to popular guides/websites, \nand anything else required to give you the edge while still remaining within the games rules.\n\nSwiftKit will be able to assist you in whatever task you may be working on in-game, whether your task is doing a quest, following a clue scroll, or just leveling up your favorite skill. \nSwiftkit will even be able to assist you in planning your next task with its multiple planning utilities such as the Quest Planner, Calculators and Highscore tools.\n\n\n\n***SCREENSHOTS***\n( Copy the links into your URL bar. )\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PNLhf.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PNLhf.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pcDd6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pcDd6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***VIDEO***\n\n\n\n\n***FEATURES***\n\n\n\n   * Skill Calculators\n   * Player Stats lookup\n   * Highscore Tools\n   * Progress Calculator\n   * Fully Integrated IRC Client\n   * Screenshot Taker, Viewer and Uploader\n   * Quest Center\n   * Adventure Log Center\n   * Events Hub\n   * Atlas\n   * Treasure Locator\n   * Server Status\n   * Armory\n   * Notepads\n   * Mp3 Player\n   * Online Radio\n   * Item, Price, Clan and Monster Databases\n   * World Clock\n   * Timers and Counters\n   * To Do List\n   * Direct Links to many RuneScape guides\n   * Monster Drop Logger\n   * Username Availability Checker\n   * SwiftBrowse as lightweight WebBrowser\n\nand many more...\n\nFound any bugs? or got anything to report come visit us at http://www.swiftkit.net/\n\n\n- [Melvintjuh]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c2d861a02af7768dd9920a4ee20b5bf66a9d7a","amp;dn":"Runescape+SwiftKit+5-5-2012+%5BMelvintjuh%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4c2d861a02af7768dd9920a4ee20b5bf66a9d7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,194,216,97,160,42,247,118,141,217,146,10,78,226,11,91,246,106,157,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
