Hyrule Field serves as the central hub connected to several outlying areas with diverse topography. Most of these areas are populated by the races of Hyrule: Hylians, Kokiri, Gorons, Zoras, Sheikahs and Gerudo.[32]\nThe game opens as the fairy Navi awakens Link from a nightmare, in which Link witnesses a stormy night where a man in black armor on horseback chases after a girl on a white horse. Navi brings Link to the guardian of Link's village, the Great Deku Tree, who is cursed and near death. Link breaks the curse, but cannot stop the tree from withering. The Deku Tree tells Link a &quot;wicked man of the desert&quot; has cursed him and seeks to conquer the land of Hyrule and that Link must stop him. Before dying, the Great Deku Tree gives Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the Kokiri's Emerald, and sends him to Hyrule Castle to speak with the &quot;princess of destiny.&quot;[33] As Link is leaving, his close friend Saria bids him good luck and gives him the Fairy Ocarina, a precursor to the Ocarina of Time. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.bayimg.com/upload&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.bayimg.com/upload&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a6ad26cd34e72645ac3a0701e04d77524933bab","amp;dn":"Legend+of+Zelda+Ocarina+of+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a6ad26cd34e72645ac3a0701e04d77524933bab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,106,210,108,211,78,114,100,90,195,160,112,30,4,215,117,36,147,59,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
