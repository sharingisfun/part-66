StudioLine Photo Classic 3 Plus manages images of all common graphics formats in a secure &quot;Image Archive&quot; database. Categorize your images with textual descriptions of any length in system descriptors or your own user descriptors, or assign keywords and ratings. After that, locating individual images or finding images to match a certain theme will be a trivial task.\n\nConvenient Geotagging\nWith the help of location data supplied by GPS data loggers or digital cameras, photos can be displayed on digital maps or satellite images. Manual geotagging is as easy as dragging each photo to its intended location on a digital map. StudioLine automatically queries the GeoNames web service for location details such as country, city, and possibly even street names. This allows photo collections to be quickly searched, filtered and sorted by cities, sights or other place names.\n\nImage Editing and Archiving\nStudioLine Photo Classic 3 Plus comes with an impressive array of professional editing tools. With a few simple steps you can turn a set of images into a slide show, publish them as a web gallery, burn a CD/DVD or send them to friends and family via Email. Also built-in are extensive print functions for any format and size imaginable, or you can print contact sheets, greeting cards, calendars and CD-covers.\n\nPresentation\nView your images in your own albums, in the advanced Timeline Explorer or by keywords and categories. Avoid data loss by backing up your image archive, with all metadata and image edits, to CD, DVD or secondary hard disk.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dl4all.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dl4all.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like buy it!\n\nPlease SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2057de61332162597ed35f93dbed280a91d49686","amp;dn":"StudioLine.Photo.Classius.3.70.46.0+%28WORKS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2057de61332162597ed35f93dbed280a91d49686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,87,222,97,51,33,98,89,126,211,95,147,219,237,40,10,145,212,150,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
