He travelled extensively, speaking internationally, but maintained daily contact with each member of the family wherever possibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦we spoke with him two hours before he died in a hospital in Worchester, England. He had been unwell for a few days, and was under observation when he went to be with Jesus. He knew he was about to leave having told a friend (Apollo Perelini) two days before &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m really tired Apollo, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be going home soon&quot;. Apollo said &quot;Back to NZ Uncle Barry?&quot; He replied &quot;No ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to be with my Lord&quot;.\n\nHis legacy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is that he has left his family completely secure with regard to where he has gone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re thrilled for him, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be with him again soon! And ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he loved people ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ teaching us that people are far more important than material things.\n\nWherever I go I meet people who have come to know Jesus as a result of my Dad, through his preaching, books and videos or meeting him personally. He wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t interested in being popular ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he just wanted people to know how to find peace with God! He made the gospel very clearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦kind of like the last of the Mohicans in terms of his no nonsense approach in presenting the gospel.\n\nKnown for relating current events to Bible prophecy, he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like the title of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“prophetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢...simply, he wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t one. Barry called himself a talker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who gave a commentary of world events and Bible prophecy.\n\nHe wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t loved by everybody ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ some accused him of scaring people into the Kingdom of God ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he maintained that going to hell was scary, but that the alternative, the gift of God, was brilliant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and that people could always readjust their motives later.\n\nOut of the pulpit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Barry was a real character. He didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just talk about being a Christian, he was one. Those who knew him personally knew him as a humorous, funny man ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ always laughing or speaking about Jesus! His favourite verse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ John 3:30, &quot;He must increase, but I must decrease.&quot;\n\nIn the last year he talked about going to Heaven a lot ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he always has really. Back in the 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s he had a quadruple bypass operation which extended his life by around 15 years. We, his family, are grateful! We have been quietly preparing for DadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s departure for some time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I spoke with him by phone a couple of hours before he died and he was in great spirits, although weak as a result of a minor heart attack. He was hoping to get on his flight home today (Friday 28th)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nAm I proud of him? Definitely ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as a family we all are! He was a real man of God in and out of the pulpit. He left no doubt as to his destination and desire to be with Jesus. He made it clear that we can see him again soonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦a very responsible man.\n\nWe miss him, and there is a lot to sort out, but he prepared us for this event and in his own words, &quot;This is not the end ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the beginning.&quot;\n\nAndrew E Smith\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
