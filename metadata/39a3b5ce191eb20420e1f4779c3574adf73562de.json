He was a famous writer and she was an up-and-coming war correspondent. They ran into each other again in Spain where they were both covering the Spanish Civil War. They were staying in the same hotel on the same floor, and she resisted his advances. However, during a bombing raid, they found themselves trapped in the same room, frightened for their lives, and lust overcame them. They became lovers and stayed in Spain until 1939. In 1940 Hemingway divorced his second wife so that they could marry. Over time she became prominent in her own right. She was unfaithful to him on occasion and in 1945 asked Hemingway for a divorceÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe only woman ever to do so. He credits her with inspiring him to write the novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls.\n\nGenre: Drama | Romance\nIMDB Rating: 6.7/10\nDirected by: Philip Kaufman\nStarring: Nicole Kidman, Clive Owen and Rodrigo Santoro\n\nRelease Name: Hemingway.and.Gellhorn.2012.HDRip.XviD-NoGRP\nSize: 1.31GB\nVideo: XviD, 624Ãƒâ€”352, 1089 Kbps, 29.970 fps\nAudio: English, MP3, 128 kbit/s\nRuntime: 2h 31mn\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39a3b5ce191eb20420e1f4779c3574adf73562de","amp;dn":"Hemingway.and.Gellhorn.2012.HDRip.XviD-NoGRP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39a3b5ce191eb20420e1f4779c3574adf73562de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,163,181,206,25,30,178,4,32,225,244,119,156,53,116,173,247,53,98,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
