An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe damage to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.\n\n\n\nDetails\nOfficial Sites:\nParamount [France] | Paramount [United States] | Add/edit official sites  Ã‚Â»\nCountry:\nUSA | United Arab Emirates\nLanguage:\nEnglish | Russian | French (only a few words) | Arabic | Swedish (only a few words)\nRelease Date:\n21 December 2011 (USA) See more Ã‚Â»\nAlso Known As:\nMi4 See more Ã‚Â»\nFilming Locations:\nGranville Island, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada See more Ã‚Â» \n\n\n\nBox Office\nBudget:\n$145,000,000 (estimated)\nOpening Weekend:\n$12,785,204 (USA) (18 December 2011) (425 Screens)\nGross:\n$637,742,169 (Worldwide) (10 February 2012)\nSee more Ã‚Â» ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be76f39caf5a54fb009f3433dfcaa1e055f6f0be","amp;dn":"Mission+Impossible+4+Ghost+Protocol+%282011%29+DVDRip+XviD-MAXOri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be76f39caf5a54fb009f3433dfcaa1e055f6f0be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,118,243,156,175,90,84,251,0,159,52,51,223,202,161,224,85,246,240,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
