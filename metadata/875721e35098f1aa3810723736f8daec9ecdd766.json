Carly (Brittany Snow) and Lena (Christian Serratos) are college students and close friends who are in an emotional funk Ã¢â‚¬â€ Lena is struggling with the aftermath of an unpleasant breakup, while CarlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family wants her to become a lawyer and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure how to stand up for her own ambitions. Their problems suddenly seem trivial when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re carjacked by Kevin (J. Michael Trautmann) and Dre (Evan Ross). Kevin, the product of an abusive upbringing, is emotionally unstable and wants to join a local youth gang; Dre, who comes from a crime-ridden neighborhood, is smart and ambitious, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too loyal to his friend to let him go out alone. When the carjacking goes wrong and someone gets shot, a tense negotiation takes place as everyone tries to keep the situation under control before the law steps in or someone dies. 96 Minutes was the first feature film from writer and director Aimee Lagos.\n\nGenre: Drama | Thriller\nIMDB rating: 8.3/10\nDirected by: Aimee Lagos\nStarring: Brittany Snow, Christian Serratos and Evan Ross\n\nRelease Name: 96 Minutes 2011 VODRiP XviD-SiC\nSize: 709.03 MB\nQuality: 720Ãƒâ€”304 | 950 Kbps | 23.976 fps | MP3 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 86 min\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:875721e35098f1aa3810723736f8daec9ecdd766","amp;dn":"96.Minutes.2011.VODRiP.XviD-SiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"875721e35098f1aa3810723736f8daec9ecdd766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,87,33,227,80,152,241,170,56,16,114,55,54,248,218,236,158,205,215,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
