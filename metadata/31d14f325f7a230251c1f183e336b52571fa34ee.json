Suppose you saw a friend's spouse cheating -- would you tell her? What if you saw a young girl being cruelly taunted by other girls - would you confront them? Using hidden cameras, ''Primetime: What Would You Do?'' sets up everyday scenarios and then captures people's reactions. Whether they're compelled to act or mind their own business, John Quinones reports on their split-second - and often surprising - decision-making process.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31d14f325f7a230251c1f183e336b52571fa34ee","amp;dn":"what.would.you.do.2012-03-16.devil.wears.prada-albinism-drop.dea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31d14f325f7a230251c1f183e336b52571fa34ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,209,79,50,95,122,35,2,81,193,241,131,227,54,181,37,113,250,52,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
