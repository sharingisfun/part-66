After the chase, where he saw Marshal Cain (Emile Meyer) get killed, he can't say &quot;no&quot; when the town asks him to take over the Marshal's duties. However, that same town starts to turn against him when he takes his new duties seriously by arresting and testifying against the killer... a boy, Eddie 'The Kid' Campbell (Robert Vaughn), who grew up in this town and comes from a broken home, garnering the sympathy of the townsfolk, who'd rather believe one of the other escaped bank robbers shot the sheriff. This is compounded by his daughter, who still has a crush on Eddie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c65178511109f3c926ee70d7245931ab6ea9278f","amp;dn":"A+Good+Day+for+a+Hanging+%281959%29+85+min.Fred+MacMurray%2CMaggie+Hay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c65178511109f3c926ee70d7245931ab6ea9278f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,81,120,81,17,9,243,201,38,238,112,215,36,89,49,171,110,169,39,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
