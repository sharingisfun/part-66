It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3be00e45da9a0364dc6ef41207cadbb53d79a577","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+10+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3be00e45da9a0364dc6ef41207cadbb53d79a577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,224,14,69,218,154,3,100,220,110,244,18,7,202,219,181,61,121,165,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
