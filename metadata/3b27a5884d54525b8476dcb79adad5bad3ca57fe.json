The main difference between this and the last release is the BSOD problem\ncertain PS3s were running into after downgrading should be all fixed up. This CFW is an\nideal candidate for those who have downgraded their consoles with a ProgSkeet or E3\nFlasher device, but can be used by anyone with access to the 3.55 firmware on their\nconsoles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b27a5884d54525b8476dcb79adad5bad3ca57fe","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+Rogero+CFW+v3.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b27a5884d54525b8476dcb79adad5bad3ca57fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,39,165,136,77,84,82,91,132,118,220,183,154,218,213,186,211,202,87,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
