Sylvia Jean 6:13 \n\nThere's an overcrowded market in the UK of female singer-songwriter-guitarists, but Patsy Matheson stands out for the quality of her singing and, more importantly, her songwriting. Best known for her work with the all-female quartet Waking the Witch, she has now recorded an intriguing DIY solo set; she co-produced and plays acoustic guitar, mandolin, glockenspiel and xylophone, with occasional subtle percussion and bass. Her best songs are thoughtful, delicate and impressively original, and include Sylvia Jean, a story of love and death in England in the 1950s, along with more intimate, personal pieces. Hotel Rooms is a finely crafted study of love and longing, while the witty but pained Hundred Guitars is the UK folk answer to You're So Vain. Then there's the delicate Under Your Wing, one of several songs that make good use of multi-tracked vocals, and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ best of all Ã¢â‚¬â€œ If You Ask Me, a gently swinging lament that deserves to become a folk standard.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/18/patsy-matheson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/18/patsy-matheson/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2120ab78028096769cbda5819d16b0230012a194","amp;dn":"Patsy+Matheson...Stories+Of+Angels+%26amp%3B+Guitars%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2120ab78028096769cbda5819d16b0230012a194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,32,171,120,2,128,150,118,156,189,165,129,157,22,176,35,0,18,161,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
