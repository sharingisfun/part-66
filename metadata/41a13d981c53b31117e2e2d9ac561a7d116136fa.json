The screenplay, based on a story by George Lucas, was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. Of the six main Star Wars films, it was the second to be released and the fifth in terms of internal trilogy.\n\n\n\nThree years after destroying the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has suffered setbacks in their struggle against the Galactic Empire. Princess Leia now leads a contingent that includes Han Solo and Luke Skywalker in a hidden base on an icy planet of the Hoth system. A probe droid, one of many sent by Darth Vader throughout the galaxy in hopes of finding Luke and the other rebels, lands on Hoth. Luke goes to investigate but is ambushed by a monstrous, furry wampa. While Han Solo searches for him, Luke frees himself from the wampa's cave with his lightsaber but soon succumbs to the freezing temperatures of the snowy wasteland. The spirit of his late mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, appears before him and instructs him to go to the planet Dagobah to train under Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Han manages to find Luke and uses the warmth of his dead tauntaun mount to keep him alive while they wait to be rescued.\n\nJust as Luke recovers, the Imperial fleet, having been alerted to the location of the Rebel base by the probe droid, launches an attack using gigantic AT-AT Walkers. The Rebels mount a strong defense, and Luke brings down a walker single-handedly after his fighter is disabled, but the base is nonetheless captured. Han and Leia escape on the Millennium Falcon with C-3PO and Chewbacca, but their hyperspace drive malfunctions, and they must hide in an asteroid field. Luke escapes with R2-D2 in an X-wing fighter and crash lands on Dagobah. He is soon found by the diminutive Yoda, who at first pretends to be a simple swamp inhabitant in order to test Luke's patience. After conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit, Yoda accepts Luke as his pupil.\n\nHan and Leia end their bickering and grow closer, but their courtship is interrupted when they must flee a giant asteroid worm. They avoid capture again by attaching the Millennium Falcon directly to the side of a Star Destroyer in Vader's fleet. Frustrated at having lost them, Vader turns to several notorious bounty hunters, including Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch). Meanwhile, Luke begins a brief period of intensive training, during which his power in the Force grows exponentially. He suffers a setback when he fails a test and sees the vision of his own face inside Darth Vader's helmet. Then he becomes troubled by premonitions of Han and Leia in pain and leaves to save them, promising to return to complete his training..................\n\n\n\n\nDirected by Irvin Kershner\nProduced by Gary Kurtz\nGeorge Lucas (executive)\nScreenplay by Leigh Brackett\nLawrence Kasdan\nStory by George Lucas\n\n\n\n\n   Mark Hamill: Luke Skywalker\n   Harrison Ford: Ian Solo\n   Carrie Fisher: Leila Organa\n   Billy Dee Williams: Lando Calrissian\n   Alec Guinness: Obi-Wan Kenobi\n   Anthony Daniels: D-3BO\n   Kenny Baker: C1-P8\n   Peter Mayhew: Chewbecca\n   David Prowse: Dart Fener\n   Denis Lawson: Wedge Antilles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Info sul file ]\n\n[b]Nome: Star Wars V.avi\nData: 23/01/2012 16:18:28\nDimensione: 1,720,403,968 bytes (1640.705 MB)\n\n[ Info generiche ]\n\nDurata: 02:02:15 (7334.72 s)\nTipo di contenitore: AVI OpenDML\nStreams totali: 3\nTipo stream n. 0: video\nTipo stream n. 1: audio\nTipo stream n. 2: audio\nAudio streams: 2\nISFT: VirtualDubMod 1.4.13\nINAM: Star Wars V\nISBJ: Star Wars V\nIART: Colleromito\nICOP: nautilus-bt.org\nJUNK: VirtualDub build 14328/release\n\n[ Giudizi sulla qualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  ]\n\nRisoluzione: MEDIA (640 x 272)\nLarghezza: multipla di 32 (BENE)\nAltezza: multipla di 16 (BENE)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  DRF medio: ALTA (2.649006)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  deviazione standard: ALTA (0.538070)\nMedia pesata dev. std.: ALTA (0.485926)\n\n[ Traccia video ]\n\nFourCC: divx/DX50\nRisoluzione: 640 x 272\nDisplay aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 25 fps\nFrames totali: 183368\nBitrate: 1349.936498 kbps\nQf: 0.310187\nMax key int: 250\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 1 ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x2000 (AC3)\nBitrate: 256 kbps CBR\nCanali: 5\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 234,711,040 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 2 ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x2000 (AC3)\nBitrate: 256 kbps CBR\nCanali: 5\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 234,711,040 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Info sulla codifica MPEG4 ]\n\nUser data: DivX503b2816p\nPacked bitstream: SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬\nInterlaced: No\nAspect ratio: Square pixels\nQuant type: H.263\nFrames totali: 183368\nFrames corrotti: 0\n\nI-VOPs:  2592 (  1.414 %)                          \nP-VOPs: 175248 ( 95.572 %) ########################\nB-VOPs:  5528 (  3.015 %) #                        \n\nMax consecutive B-VOPs: 1\n\n[ Analisi DRF ]\n\nDRF medio: 2.649006\nDeviazione standard: 0.538070\nDRF max: 6\n\nDRF=1:    84 (  0.046 %)                          \nDRF=2: 69492 ( 37.898 %) #########                \nDRF=3: 108677 ( 59.267 %) ###############          \nDRF=4:  5023 (  2.739 %) #                        \nDRF=5:     0 (  0.000 %)                          \nDRF=6:    92 (  0.050 %)                          \nDRF&gt;6:     0 (  0.000 %)                          \n\nRapporto generato da AVInaptic (26-05-2007) in data 16 feb 2012, h 12:16:43\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41a13d981c53b31117e2e2d9ac561a7d116136fa","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+V.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41a13d981c53b31117e2e2d9ac561a7d116136fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,161,61,152,28,83,179,17,23,226,226,217,172,86,26,125,17,97,54,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
