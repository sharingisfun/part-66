The multi-camera series will begin production in Hollywood this summer for a scheduled late 2011 premiere on Disney Channel. Starring are newcomer Ross Lynch as Austin, Laura Marano (&quot;Without a Trace,&quot; &quot;Back to You&quot;) as Ally, Raini Rodriguez (Disney's &quot;Prom,&quot; &quot;I'm in the Band&quot;) as Trish and Calum Worthy (&quot;Psych,&quot; &quot;Good Luck Charlie&quot;) as Dez. The series follows the partnership between polar opposites -- Austin, an extroverted musician/singer, and Ally, a brilliant yet shy songwriter -- and their two best friends, Trish and Dez. Unbeknownst to Ally, Austin and Dez &quot;borrow&quot; one of her songs, record it, create a video and post it on the Internet, after which it and Austin become a local sensation. When Trish convinces Ally to tell the world she wrote the song, Austin pleads with her to write another hit for him. Instead, the two combine their talents to create a true musical tour-de-force. \n\nanyway i though i upload this\n \np.s any comments will be helpfull","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f532c0a334521b66e075af331bae53fc33aa6681","amp;dn":"Austin.%26amp%3B.Ally.S01E10.World.Records.%26amp%3B.Work.Wreckers.720p.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f532c0a334521b66e075af331bae53fc33aa6681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,50,192,163,52,82,27,102,224,117,175,51,27,174,83,252,51,170,102,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
