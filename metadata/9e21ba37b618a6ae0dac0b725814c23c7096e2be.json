Waking from a coma in a deserted London hospital 28 days later, bicycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) takes to the deserted city streets in a state of mystified confusion. Joining forces with another group of survivors following a terrifying encounter in a seemingly abandoned church, Jim soon learns the truth behind the deserted streets and the menacing creatures that lurk in the shadows. It's soon revealed that the chimpanzees had been harboring a deadly virus that sends its victims into a furious, murderous rage, and in the days following the initial exposure, the entire population was nearly wiped out due to the resulting homicidal rampage. Is there still a glimmer of hope for humanity -- or has the deadly &quot;rage&quot; virus found its way to foreign shores and infected the entire planet. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e21ba37b618a6ae0dac0b725814c23c7096e2be","amp;dn":"28+Days+Later","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e21ba37b618a6ae0dac0b725814c23c7096e2be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,33,186,55,182,24,166,174,13,172,11,114,88,20,194,60,112,150,226,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
