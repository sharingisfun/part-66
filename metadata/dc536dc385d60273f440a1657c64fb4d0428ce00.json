I tested this on a Samsung Galaxy SII (Rooted) and it worked perfectly on the first try and I didn't have to restart my phone.\n\nYou will need to install Lucky Patcher, PowerAMP Full Unlocker and PowerAMP itself.\n\n1. After installing PowerAMP (don't run it) and installing Lucky Patcher, run Lucky Patcher.\n\n2. Let it search your phone and then when its done hold down PowerAMP.\n\n3. Select Custom Patch! and allow it to do what it does.\n\n4. When it's done exit Lucky Patcher and open the PowerAMP Full Unlocker.\n\n5. Give it super user access and then patch PowerAMP.\n\n6. All finished. Run PowerAMP and then select settings and make sure there isn't an error.  If there is just reboot your device and all should be good.\n\nEnjoy your music with this awesome pain in the ass app lol.\n\nSeed and Comment\n\nI also included a widgit pack. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc536dc385d60273f440a1657c64fb4d0428ce00","amp;dn":"PowerAMP+v2.0+Build+449+%28Rooted+Devices+Only%29+%28TyMoD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc536dc385d60273f440a1657c64fb4d0428ce00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,83,109,195,133,214,2,115,244,64,161,101,124,100,251,77,4,40,206,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
