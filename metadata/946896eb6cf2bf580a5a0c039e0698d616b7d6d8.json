Now, the bullÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-eye is on Iran. But what we need more than a simple change of target is a complete change in perspective, says [b]Andrew Bacevich[/b], a West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran-turned-scholar whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become one of the most perceptive observers of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changing role in the world.\n\nThis week, on an all-new [i]Moyers &amp; Company[/i], Bill Moyers and Bacevich explore the futility of Ã¢â‚¬Å“endlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ wars, and provide a reality check on the rhetoric of American exceptionalism.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Are we so unimaginative, so wedded to the reliance on military means that we cannot conceive of any way to reconcile our differences with groups and nations in the Islamic world, and therefore bring this conflict to an end?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bacevich tells Moyers.\n\nBacevich also answers the question of whether Iran is a direct threat to America with a definitive no. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whatever threat Iran poses is very, very limited,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he tells Moyers, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and certainly does not constitute any kind of justification for yet another experiment with preventive war.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEpisode webpage:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/moving-beyond-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/moving-beyond-war/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----\n\nType: mp4 file\nSize: 284MB\nRuntime: 00:56:46\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 640x360\nAudio: AAC 44100Hz stereo 108Kbps \n\nYou can also watch a flash video of this episode through your web-browser here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/moving-beyond-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/moving-beyond-war/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:946896eb6cf2bf580a5a0c039e0698d616b7d6d8","amp;dn":"Moyers+and+Company%2C+Mar+23+2012%3A+Moving+Beyond+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"946896eb6cf2bf580a5a0c039e0698d616b7d6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,104,150,235,108,242,191,88,10,90,12,3,158,6,152,214,22,183,214,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
