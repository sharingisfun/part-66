On the evening of Thursday 19th July 1973 in the \nintimate surrounds of Ebbets Field in Colorado, Little Feat played two shows, \nwith the team from KCUV FM on hand to broadcast both. The two sets performed \nfeatured similar track-lists, and while this CD features the late show in its entirety, as a bonus the three tracks from the earlier performances that weren't played again, are also included here. With a truly powerful delivery, wonderful soundthroughout, and the band as tight as they ever were, this now legendary gig represents one of North America s truly iconic bands at their very finest - and in a performance that might well be the best they ever played.''\n\nTrack List.\n \n1.
