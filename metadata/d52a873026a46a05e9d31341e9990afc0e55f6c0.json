At the story's center is Martin Bohm, a widower and single father, haunted by an inability to connect to his emotionally challenged 11-year-old son, Jake. Caring, intelligent and thoughtful, Martin has tried everything to reach his son. But Jake never speaks, shows little emotion, and never allows himself to be touched by anyone, including Martin. Jake is obsessed with numbersÃ¢â‚¬â€writing long strings of them in his ever-present notebooksÃ¢â‚¬â€and with discarded cell phones.\nSocial worker Clea Hopkins believes that Jake's needs are too serious for Martin to handle. She sees a man whose life has become dominated by a child he can no longer control. She believes that it's time for the state to intervene. So Jake is placed in foster care, despite Martin's desperate objections.\nBut everything changes after Martin meets Arthur Teller, a professor and an expert on children who possess special gifts when it comes to numbers. Martin learns that Jake possesses an extraordinary giftÃ¢â‚¬â€the ability to perceive the seemingly hidden patterns that connect every life on the planet. While Martin wants nothing more than to communicate directly with his son, Jake connects to his father through numbers, not words. Martin realizes that it's his job to decipher these numbers and recognize their meaning. As he puts the pieces together, he will help people across the world connect as their lives intersect according to the patterns Jake has foreseen.\nMartin's quest to connect with his son will shape humanity's destiny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d52a873026a46a05e9d31341e9990afc0e55f6c0","amp;dn":"Touch.S01E11-1re.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-CtrlHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d52a873026a46a05e9d31341e9990afc0e55f6c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,42,135,48,38,164,106,5,233,211,19,65,233,153,10,252,14,85,246,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
