It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28b2e728d5639c99dc24de9c4a6357e768f42e74","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+10+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28b2e728d5639c99dc24de9c4a6357e768f42e74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,178,231,40,213,99,156,153,220,36,222,156,74,99,87,231,104,244,46,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
