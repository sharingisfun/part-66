A year in the making, 'Hennail' renders their illicit sound with an ever finer appreciation of tonal subtlety and tendon-tightening rhythmic dynamism. Their influences - militant, misanthropic post punk, hydraulic hardcore jungle and wasteland ambience - are more explicit than ever, yet utterly dissolute from the mass. On 'Told And Collapsed' the drums hang and swoon with a filigree syncopation owing as much to The Danse Society as Source Direct, while vein-popping industrial hollers are inverted deep into the matrix, beautifully accenting the track's barely-repressed violence at the most crucial, tongue biting moments. On 'You Will Lift Your Frame Clear' shuddering bass takes precedence, desecrating their soundsphere with a noxious, choking presence giving license to the onset of cenobite synth sighs and awning strings which subliminally ratchet the terror levels to startling degrees.
