It would be best to have both of these collections, as this Pack often has serials you cannot find in the SBox.\n\nUnlike SBox, no readers are required. Just open the dmg file, drag and drop the app where you like.\n\nHowever, there is no way to view what serials, cracks and patches are new in this issue as compared to the previous.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel or PPC Mac OS version: Mac OS X 10.3.9 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2a92da32cf4ba0964a38990a07a29063231cec6","amp;dn":"+KCNcrew+Pack+04-15-12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2a92da32cf4ba0964a38990a07a29063231cec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,169,45,163,44,244,186,9,100,163,137,144,160,122,41,6,50,49,206,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
