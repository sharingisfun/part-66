More Lemmings\n\nThis torrent was originally created by thenoobish for MAC OSX.  I simply extracted all the files, deleted the MAC bloat files, and re-zipped it.  As it's able to run on any Java capable OS, it's quite easy to get working on most devices.\nUnlike most Lemmings games you may find being uploaded, this has a client called Lemmini.jar to allow the game to be run in full screen, rather than a tiny screen you can hardly play on.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nOS: Any Java capable OS\nGames included:  Lemmings, Oh No! More Lemmings\n\nAlso includes: Original Amiga MOD music, VGA PC graphics, Lemmini client, and the Windows version of Lemmings which is needed to extract the game files from.\n\nMAC OSX version: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5297421/Lemmings_for_Mac_OS_X","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fddb3039d39dbd3ba9b1c0e6eaac3acea97b706","amp;dn":"Lemmings+%26amp%3B+Oh+No%21+More+Lemmings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fddb3039d39dbd3ba9b1c0e6eaac3acea97b706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,221,179,3,157,57,219,211,186,155,28,14,110,170,195,172,234,151,183,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
