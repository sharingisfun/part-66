Representatives both from a Hasidic cabalistic sect and high-powered Wall Street firm hear of that secret and attempt to seduce him.\n\nThe mathematician Maximillian Cohen is tormented by a severe migraine since he was a kid, and he uses many pills to reduce his painful headaches. He is a lonely man, and his only friend is his former professor Sol Robeson. Max has the following assumptions, which rules his life: (1) Mathematics is the language of nature; (2) Everything around us can be represented and understood from numbers; (3) If you graph the numbers in any system, patterns emerge. Therefore there are patterns everywhere in nature. Based on these principles, Max is trying to figure out a system to predict the behavior of the stock market. Due to his research, Max is chased by a Wall Street company with obvious interest in the results of his studies, and by a Chasidic Torah scholar, who believes that this long string of numbers is a code sent from God.  Written by Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n\nIn Manhattan, behind six locks, lives Max Cohen, a mathematician and computer whiz. Since staring at the sun at age six, he's had terrible headaches; plus, he can't abide human contact except with an aging professor, and he's obsessed with finding numeric patterns. His current obsession is the stock market; his theories bring him to the attention of Wall Street traders. He also keeps running into Lenny, a fast-talking Chasidic who fronts for a cabal that wants to rediscover long-lost mathematical mysteries in the Torah. Neither group is benign, and they pursue Max as his hallucinations and headaches worsen. Does nature offer any solutions? Can Max find them?\n\nGeneral\n      Complete name : Pi (1998)\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave / DVDRIP\n      File size : 699 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 23mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1167 Kbps\nVideo #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Duration : 1h 23mn\n      Bit rate : 966 Kbps\n      Width : 480 pixels\n      Height : 288 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.291\n      Stream size : 579 MiB (83%)\nAudio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 23mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Video delay : 30ms\n      Stream size : 115 MiB (16%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c45cb26c4c9fc2b516c80cb9662a2a29515f44","amp;dn":"Pi+%281998%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c45cb26c4c9fc2b516c80cb9662a2a29515f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,196,92,178,108,76,159,194,181,22,200,12,185,102,42,42,41,81,95,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
