Most impressively, it shows how they protect dignitaries. The premiere showcases the effort that goes into protecting the economy, the president of the United States, foreign leaders and others.\n\n\nAt the beginning of each episode, a voice-over states that protecting the president is only a small part of the Secret Service's duties. The fact that the Secret Service deals primarily with counterfeit money is not readily known. \n\n\n\nThe four-part series is thorough in covering every aspect of the Secret Service. Though overly dramatic at times, the viewer leaves with the realization that the Secret Service is an intricate organization that foils crime on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\n    \n            \n\n\nNarrated by: Erik Thompson\n==========================\n\nDirected &amp; Produced by: Peter Schnall\n=====================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: Secret Service Files\nYear.................: 2011\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:45:48 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: ( AC3 ) \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: H264 \nVideo Resolution.....: 624x352 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 2158 kbit/s ( ) 2166 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: N/A\nFile Size:...........: 706 MB ( ) 709 MB\nFPS..................: 23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 2011\nParts................: 4 Episodes\n\n\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1842173/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1842173/&lt;/a&gt;          (General information)\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1842173/episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1842173/episodes&lt;/a&gt;  (Episodes)\n\n\n\n\n   Episodes:\n   =========\n\n1) Battlefront Columbia\n2) Frontline New York City\n3) Undercover Miami\n4) United Nations Lockdown\n\n\n\n\n\n[HDTV/H264:]\n============\n\n\n\n\n \n \nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9254d5b5bf05ec467e6e18dc0b08b1ed8527fc","amp;dn":"Secret+Service+Files-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9254d5b5bf05ec467e6e18dc0b08b1ed8527fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,146,84,213,181,191,5,236,70,126,110,24,220,11,8,177,237,133,39,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
