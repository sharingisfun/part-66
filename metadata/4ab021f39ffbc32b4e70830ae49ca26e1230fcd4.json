Easy to use and excellent for tech repairs, data recovery and security audits.\n\n&quot;Commercial Kon-Boot version works with both 64-bit and 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems and also include privilege escalation feature.\n\n&quot;Free Kon-Boot version is still available but it does not support 64 bit systems and Windows 7. It also does not include privilege escalation feature.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab021f39ffbc32b4e70830ae49ca26e1230fcd4","amp;dn":"Kon-BootV2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab021f39ffbc32b4e70830ae49ca26e1230fcd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,176,33,243,159,251,195,43,78,112,131,10,228,156,162,110,18,48,252,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
