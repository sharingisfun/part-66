It is listed at $6.99. Here is the complete app description:\n\n    Four months have passed since Kal ruined the VolteritesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ plans by sabotaging their war factories, and stopping the extraction of the Judger Artifacts. However, following the assassination of President Folsom, the government surrendered the colonies to the Volterite Protectorate in order to prevent civil war between the increasingly pro-Volterite citizens.\n\n    Kal Wardin has been laying low since FolsomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, nut now he has received a desperate plea from Yelena to come to Earth. Once again, the hero must rise to save mankind!\n\nThe game offers 10 levels of fighting across the galaxy with new weapons, from a war-torn Earth to a frozen Volterite city.\n\nPast the single player storyline, there are 12-player battles in six multiplayer modes. And for the first time, multiple allies can jump in the same vehicle and spread destruction across the battlefield.\n\nN.O.V.A. 3 is a sequel to 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s N.O.V.A. 2: The Hero Rises. The original N.O.V.A (Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance) game was released in the App Store in 2009.\n\nThe updated visuals look amazing, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking forward to playing the game. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have a complete review of N.O.V.A. 3 for you soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0281e2d9dae09c1b809e639c6c95c09f0aea4cb2","amp;dn":"NOVA_3_1.0_by_URUGUAY.ipa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0281e2d9dae09c1b809e639c6c95c09f0aea4cb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,129,226,217,218,224,156,27,128,158,99,156,108,149,192,159,10,234,76,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
