Prohibition was repealed because it made matters worse. Today, no one is trying to sell our kids bathtub gin in the schoolyard and micro-breweries are not protecting their turf with machine guns. It is time to apply that thinking to marijuana. By making it a legal, regulated product, availability can be restricted, under-age use curtailed, enforcement/court/incarceration costs reduced, and the profit removed from a massive underground and criminal economy.\n\nBy managing marijuana like alcohol and tobacco Ã¢â‚¬â€œ regulating, taxing and enforcing its lawful use Ã¢â‚¬â€œ America will be better off.  The billions saved on marijuana interdiction, along with the billions captured as legal revenue, can be redirected against the individuals committing real crimes against American society. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f52c90cef4d3a883aa5c81940a2e209ea012313","amp;dn":"20120605+The+Daily+Show+%5B+Gary+Johnson+Segment+%5D++wmv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f52c90cef4d3a883aa5c81940a2e209ea012313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,82,201,12,239,77,58,136,58,165,200,25,64,162,226,9,234,1,35,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
