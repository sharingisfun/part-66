A former business associate from Berlin's underworld pays a call asking Ripley's help in killing a rival. Ripley - ever a student of human nature - initiates a game to turn a mild and innocent local picture framer into a hit man. The artisan, Jonathan Trevanny, who's dying of cancer, has a wife, young son, and little to leave them. If Ripley draws Jonathan into the game, can Ripley maintain control? Does it stop at one killing? What if Ripley develops a conscience? Luisa prepares for her concert.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed378bdcfaaf536fe7af39e60ca229ba1ce7f55c","amp;dn":"Ripleys+Game+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed378bdcfaaf536fe7af39e60ca229ba1ce7f55c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,55,139,220,250,175,83,111,231,175,57,230,12,162,41,186,28,231,245,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
