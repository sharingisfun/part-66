The title track is based on tribal drums and a rasping, menacing bassline, but it's the Ground Loop version that really impresses. The drums are more pounding and the interplay with the atmospheric chords lends it a dynamism, while the pounding beats are reminiscent of SP-X's work for Komisch and Time To Express.But Velo isn't concerned solely with slamming rhythms and 'Lines Will Appear' sees her conjure up warm, enveloping chords over spiky percussive shards. On a similar tact is &quot;District 03&quot;, where a skipping rhythm provides the basis for a seductive chord sequence.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Nass (Original Mix) (06:56), 15.90 MB\n02.
