To achieve this I made use of the Source-Engine's shared GCF files. More information about this can be found in the README file.\n\nMultiplayer games were left out on purpose, mainly because they're updated too often and there are already about a million releases of them. They don't fit the idea behind this package.\n\nThis is my first release, I put a lot of work and time into it to make sure everything works fine. Feedback is appreciated!\n\nHave fun!\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nAmazingly small installer filesize compared to common Standalone releases\nUses unmodified files directly from STEAM, nothing was changed from the original content.\nIncorporates newest updates to the SOURCE engine for all games, including achievements (as of 11/23/11)\nInternational (English) release, can be expanded with other languages\nPrecracked, no need for STEAM or internet connection\nCustom installer/uninstaller with the option to select only the games you want to install, each game can be installed as a standalone.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Mount\n2. Run installer\n3. Read the text at the beginning to avoid questions later (or read the README file)\n4. Select the games you want to install\n5. Launch games from any shortcut\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1240.photobucket.com/albums/gg498/Godmode1/animation_forum_2.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1240.photobucket.com/albums/gg498/Godmode1/animation_forum_2.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nVersion 1.22 (02/11/2012):\nUpdated the README file with additional info.\nReworked the setup routine: new art, more info, code improvments.\nAdded a 'print' button on the bottom of the README page.\nAdded an uninstall prompt regarding savegames.\nAdded background music and a 'toggle music' button.\nAdded 64bit support.\nFixed: 'next disk' prompt is now readable.\nFixed: game symbols were displayed incorrectly for some people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cae88b75447ea6f66d3afbe676b57e67debf4d42","amp;dn":"Half-Life+universe+EN+v1.22+%5B02-11-2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cae88b75447ea6f66d3afbe676b57e67debf4d42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,232,139,117,68,126,166,246,109,58,251,230,118,181,126,103,222,191,77,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
