My show tonight was filmed with an audience at Florida State University.\n\nSome students shared how my Stossel in the Classroom videos helped teach them economics. They learned more about free markets from their professors, Joe Calhoun and Jim Gwartney, who join us to explain how politicians disregard the laws of economics.\n\nWe also cover free speech on campus with Greg Lukianoff of FIRE, along with Eric Philips and Chris Morbitzer, students who faced censorship at Auburn University and the University of Cincinnati.\n\nBrian Yablonski shares another counterintuitive idea that I write about in No They Can't: the best way to save animals is to kill them. Yablonski, who's on the Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission describes how hunters are the best environmentalists. They do a better job preserving land and animals than government.\n\nElizabeth Foley of the Institute for Justice joins us to shed light on stupid laws in Florida--like the one that shuts down businesses that provide teeth whitening services. The state dental board claims that's illegal &quot;unlicensed practice of dentistry.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8be42bc4313a014a4ad86103db8300e9159c03","amp;dn":"20120419-Stossel-%5Bon+campus+for+No+They+Can%27t%5D.Fox+Business.CF.a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8be42bc4313a014a4ad86103db8300e9159c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,139,228,43,196,49,58,1,74,74,216,97,3,219,131,0,233,21,156,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
