Quarter final. Champions League. Second Leg (3/4/12)\n\n\nJosep GuardiolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side has a crunch fixture on Tuesday night against AC Milan, kicking off at 20.45. A place in the Champions League is at stake and it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be easy after the goalless draw at the Giuseppe Meazza. The team will need the supportersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ help more than ever. They are the twelfth member of this team, and together the players and fans can take BarÃƒÂ§a into the semi finals.\n\n\nTherefore, the club is calling on supporters to be at the Camp Nou in good time, by 20.00, when the players will come out for their warm-up. That way the team will know from the very start how much the fans are behind them. To help, the gates to the stadium will be open from 19.15. Also, when the players come out of the tunnel, they are going to be welcomed by a mosaic reading Ã¢â‚¬ËœSempre JuntsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Catalan for Ã¢â‚¬ËœAlways togetherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nIn his post-match press conference last week, Josep Guardiola made it clear how important the supporters are at times like this. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The fans canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let us down on Tuesday. They have to come to help us into the semi finals. These players have done too much to be left alone. On Tuesday we have a final in our own stadium and in front of our people. We need the stadium to be full. We have a good chance of winning and together weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nResolution: 1280 x 720\nSound: Stereo.
