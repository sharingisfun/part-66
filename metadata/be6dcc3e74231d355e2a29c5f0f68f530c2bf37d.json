Catherine Deneuve is Carol, a fragile, frigid young beauty cracking up in her London flat when left alone by her vacationing sister. She is soon haunted by specters real and imagined, and her insanity grows to a violent, hysterical pitch. Thanks to its disturbing detail and Polanskis adeptness at turning claustrophobic space into an emotional minefield, Repulsion is a surreal, mind-bending odyssey into personal horror, and it remains one of cinemas most shocking psychological thrillers.\n\nFilm Essays\nRepulsion: Eye of the Storm By Bill Horrigan: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1207-repulsion-eye-of-the-storm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1207-repulsion-eye-of-the-storm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRepulsion By Michael Sragow &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/923-repulsion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/923-repulsion&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6dcc3e74231d355e2a29c5f0f68f530c2bf37d","amp;dn":"Repulsion+%281965%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29+Criterion+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6dcc3e74231d355e2a29c5f0f68f530c2bf37d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,109,204,62,116,35,29,53,94,42,41,197,240,246,143,83,12,43,243,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
