Because NetbootCD downloads the latest installer, which in turn downloads the latest system components, you can install a fully up-to-date system without burning a new CD.\nThe current version of NetbootCD is version 4.8, available from TuxFamily. It is built on a Core-4.2.1 base, with kexec support added to the kernel. The ISO image can be burned to a CD/DVD or written to a flash drive.\nI have also made available an ISO image with NetbootCD 4.8 and CorePlus 4.2.1. It should work with CDs or USB drives, and includes everything in CorePlus. A new feature lets you boot to the X desktop and then run NetbootCD after exiting to the prompt. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNotes (for 4.9)\n    * NetbootCD uses a recompiled Tiny Core Linux kernel with kexec support. The kexec-tools binaries are in the initrd (nbinit4.gz) and, on the NetbootCD + CorePlus ISO, they are also in a kexec.tcz archive on the CD so you can use kexec from within Tiny Core.\n    * In the NetbootCD + CorePlus ISO, you can launch NetbootCD with the CorePlus add-ons. The CorePlus desktop will show up first, and you can run the NetbootCD script by exiting to the command prompt and running 'netboot'.\n    * NetbootCD 4.5+ has a new 'script' option on the main menu. With this option, you can have NetbootCD load and parse a SYSLINUX-formatted boot configuration and do its best to run one of the boot options specified.\n          o Multiple initrds are supported, but they are combined in memory, so the process takes a bit longer.\n          o Kernels other than Linux and GRUB4DOS probably won't work.\n          o You can choose to search for syslinux.cfg, isolinux.cfg, pxelinux.cfg, or nbcd.cfg. The search checks the CD-ROM first, then all disks listed in 'fdisk -l'. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/#Notes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/#Notes&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/#Downloads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/#Downloads&lt;/a&gt; (floppy,...)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/#Supported%20Distributions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/#Supported%20Distributions&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/#Licensing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://netbootcd.tuxfamily.org/#Licensing&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : 3b5e530776f53a54671abdb2215fd96a  NetbootCD-4.9.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d38657317c07a742068685e15a0108eae3d8fe9","amp;dn":"NetbootCD-4.9.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d38657317c07a742068685e15a0108eae3d8fe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,56,101,115,23,192,122,116,32,104,104,94,21,160,16,142,174,61,143,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
