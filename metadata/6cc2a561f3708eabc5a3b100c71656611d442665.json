It is the third film released in the Star Wars saga, and the sixth in terms of the series' internal chronology. It is the first film to use THX technology.\n\n\n\nLuke Skywalker initiates a plan to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt with the help of Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. Leia infiltrates Jabba's palace on Tatooine disguised as a bounty hunter and releases Han, but Leia is captured and enslaved and Han is detained. Luke arrives a week later and allows himself to be captured. After surviving an attempted feeding to the Rancor, Jabba sentences Luke and Han to be executed by the Sarlacc. Luke breaks free, retrieving his newly-constructed lightsaber from R2-D2 and a large battle erupts; in the ensuing chaos, Leia strangles Jabba to death, Han inadvertently knocks Boba Fett into the gaping maw of the Sarlacc and Luke, escaping with his allies, destroys Jabba's sail barge. While Han and Leia rendezvous with the other Rebels, Luke returns to Dagobah, only to find that Yoda is dying. With his last breaths, Yoda confirms that Darth Vader is Luke's father and that Luke must confront him again to become a true Jedi Knight; he also mentions &quot;another Skywalker&quot;. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi reveals that the &quot;other Skywalker&quot; Yoda spoke of is Luke's twin sister, whom Luke discovers is Leia. Obi-Wan then tells Luke that he must confront Vader once more to defeat the Galactic Empire after confirming that Vader was originally Anakin Skywalker.\n\nThe Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a new Death Star. In a plan to destroy the new weapon, Han leads a strike team to destroy the battle station's shield generator on the moon Endor, allowing a squadron of starfighters to enter the incomplete superstructure and destroy the station from within. Returning from Dagobah, Luke joins the strike team along with Leia and the others. The strike team travels to Endor in an Imperial shuttle; Vader senses Luke's presence on the shuttle, but lets them through so that they will be ambushed by the Imperial forces lying in wait on Endor. Sensing Vader's presence, Luke fears he is endangering the mission by his presence.\n\nOn Endor, Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of Ewoks and form a partnership with them. Later, Luke confesses to Leia that she is his sister, that Vader is their father and that he is leaving to confront him, thinking that there is still good in him. Luke surrenders to Imperial troops, so that they will bring him to Vader. He unsuccessfully tries to convince Vader to turn from the dark side, but Vader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), his Sith master and leader of the Empire...................\n\n\n\n\nDirected by Irvin Kershner\nProduced by Gary Kurtz\nGeorge Lucas (executive)\nScreenplay by Leigh Brackett\nLawrence Kasdan\nStory by George Lucas\n\n\n\n\n   Mark Hamill: Luke Skywalker\n   Harrison Ford: Ian Solo\n   Carrie Fisher: Leila Organa\n   Billy Dee Williams: Lando Calrissian\n   Alec Guinness: Obi-Wan Kenobi\n   Anthony Daniels: D-3BO\n   Kenny Baker: C1-P8\n   Peter Mayhew: Chewbecca\n   David Prowse: Dart Fener\n   Denis Lawson: Wedge Antilles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ Info sul file ]\n\nNome: Star Wars VI.avi\nData: 23/01/2012 16:27:34\nDimensione: 1,819,389,952 bytes (1735.105 MB)\n\n[ Info generiche ]\n\nDurata: 02:09:15 (7754.84 s)\nTipo di contenitore: AVI OpenDML\nStreams totali: 3\nTipo stream n. 0: video\nTipo stream n. 1: audio\nTipo stream n. 2: audio\nAudio streams: 2\nISFT: VirtualDubMod 1.4.13\nINAM: Star Wars VI\nISBJ: Star Wars VI\nIART: Colleromito\nICOP: nautilus-bt.org\nJUNK: VirtualDub build 14328/release\n\n[ Giudizi sulla qualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  ]\n\nRisoluzione: MEDIA (640 x 272)\nLarghezza: multipla di 32 (BENE)\nAltezza: multipla di 16 (BENE)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  DRF medio: ALTA (2.973420)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  deviazione standard: ALTA (0.770341)\nMedia pesata dev. std.: ALTA (0.564987)\n\n[ Traccia video ]\n\nFourCC: divx/DX50\nRisoluzione: 640 x 272\nDisplay aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 25 fps\nFrames totali: 193871\nBitrate: 1350.401102 kbps\nQf: 0.310294\nMax key int: 250\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 1 ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x2000 (AC3)\nBitrate: 256 kbps CBR\nCanali: 5\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 248,154,880 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 2 ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x2000 (AC3)\nBitrate: 256 kbps CBR\nCanali: 5\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 248,154,880 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Info sulla codifica MPEG4 ]\n\nUser data: DivX503b2816p\nPacked bitstream: SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬\nInterlaced: No\nAspect ratio: Square pixels\nQuant type: H.263\nFrames totali: 193871\nFrames corrotti: 0\n\nI-VOPs:  3516 (  1.814 %)                          \nP-VOPs: 173371 ( 89.426 %) ######################  \nB-VOPs: 16984 (  8.760 %) ##                      \n\nMax consecutive B-VOPs: 1\n\n[ Analisi DRF ]\n\nDRF medio: 2.973420\nDeviazione standard: 0.770341\nDRF max: 8\n\nDRF=1:    34 (  0.018 %)                          \nDRF=2: 44111 ( 22.753 %) ######                  \nDRF=3: 121332 ( 62.584 %) ################        \nDRF=4: 23071 ( 11.900 %) ###                      \nDRF=5:    24 (  0.012 %)                          \nDRF=6:  5294 (  2.731 %) #                        \nDRF=7:     0 (  0.000 %)                          \nDRF=8:     5 (  0.003 %)                          \nDRF&gt;8:     0 (  0.000 %)                          \n\nRapporto generato da AVInaptic (26-05-2007) in data 16 feb 2012, h 12:49:54\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc2a561f3708eabc5a3b100c71656611d442665","amp;dn":"%5BDivX+ac3+ITA+ENG%5D+Star+Wars+VI+Return+of+the+Jedi+%28nautilus-bt.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc2a561f3708eabc5a3b100c71656611d442665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,194,165,97,243,112,142,171,197,163,177,0,199,22,86,97,29,68,38,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
