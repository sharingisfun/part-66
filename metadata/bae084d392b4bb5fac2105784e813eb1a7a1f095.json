He sends Watson because Holmes himself is too busy in London. Lady Frances is a lone, unwed woman denied a rich inheritance on account of her gender. She does, however, carry valuable jewels with her. It is also her habit to write to her old governess, Miss Dobney, every other week, but for the past five weeks, there has not been a word from her. She has left the HÃƒÂ´tel National for parts unknown. Her last two bank transactions were cheques, one to pay her hotel bill, and another for Ã‚Â£50 to her maid, Miss Marie Devine.\nIn Switserland, Watson finds out that Lady Frances stayed at the HÃƒÂ´tel International for several weeks, but then suddenly left in a hurry one day. Only one witness could suggest an explanation, one involving a big, bearded man who kept hounding her. It also emerges that Lady FrancesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s maid has left her employ, although it is not known why.\nThe search seems hopeless. The police follow known associates, Holmes places advertisements hoping to learn something, but nothing happens. \nThe Granada TV adaption starring Jeremy Brett was not completely faithful to the original story. The main action takes place in the Lake District, and though the Peters' are apprehended, the ending is ultimately more downbeat; Lady Frances is psychologically traumatized by the deadly experience and is unlikely to fully recover. Holmes acknowledges the case as of his few true failures, refusing to be rewarded by Green for bringing about a tragedy. \n\nHash code: Selecteer alles\n\nBAE084D392B4BB5FAC2105784E813EB1A7A1F095\n\nby Chamond\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bae084d392b4bb5fac2105784e813eb1a7a1f095","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes%3A+The+disappearance+of+Lady+Frances+Carfax+%28AVI%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bae084d392b4bb5fac2105784e813eb1a7a1f095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,224,132,211,146,180,187,95,172,33,5,120,78,129,62,177,167,161,240,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
