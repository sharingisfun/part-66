Iraq war veteran Walter Sherman (Geoff Stults) gained a reputation in his army days as being the go-to guy for tracking down insurgents and deserters and finding improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Unfortunately one IED found Walter before he could find it, resulting in severe brain damage with a lasting and unexpected effect. Walter transformed from someone skilled at the standard recovery of people and things in wartime scenarios to someone - something - much more extraordinary: a Finder. Walter left the military, but his reputation as a discreet professional able to unearth anything and anyone passed on to generals, politicians and other powerful figures. \n\n\nVertaling: Jesse, Quetsbeek en DÃƒÂ©sirÃƒÂ©e\n\n\nSeizoen 1 Aflevering 6: Little Green Men\n\nDr. Jack Hodgins from the Jeffersonian team seeks Walter's help to find evidence that could expose extraterrestrial activity. Meanwhile, Timo and Willa struggle with their arranged marriage proclaimed by the head of their gypsy family.\n\n\n\n\nDeze serie wordt u aangeboden door het DutchReleaseTeam.\nVoor de reviews van de nieuwste films, muziek, series, games etc\nga dan eens naar http://www.hetmultimediacafe.be/\n\nDutchReleaseteam = Hardcoded Dutch Subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f30983bf0fd6367d380dd35caa34f6bc2dbe570","amp;dn":"The+Finder+S01E06+HDTV+Nl+subs+DutchReleaseTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f30983bf0fd6367d380dd35caa34f6bc2dbe570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,48,152,59,240,253,99,103,211,128,221,53,202,163,79,107,194,219,229,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
