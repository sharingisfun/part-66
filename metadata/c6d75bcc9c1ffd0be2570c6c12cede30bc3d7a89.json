Amazing action sequences, suspense and scares, gore, violence and plenty of laughs! On the surface, Ninja Zombies is an action-comedy-horror film, or a zom-com with martial arts. At itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core, however, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a film about friendship, growing up, and accepting responsibilities that you never wanted. Dameon, a young landlord with no real job or obligations, begins having nightmares Ã¢â‚¬â€œ flashes from the life of a samurai on the run who tries to rid his world of an evil Hell Sword that could raise the dead (the Jigoku no Ken). When he finds a chest containing his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ancestral sword and a mysterious journal, he realizes that his dreams were real and the samurai was his ancestor. He discovers that there are two swords: this one from the chest is good and grants him his ancestorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fighting power, but the evil sword from his dreams is also realÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nGenre: Horror\nIMDB rating: 8.3/10\nDirected by: Noah Cooper\nStarring: Michael Castro, Pamela Chan and Adam Discko\n\nRelease Name: Ninja.Zombies.2011.DVDrip.XVID-THS\nSize: 1.4GB\nVideo: XviD, 720Ãƒâ€”576, 2190 Kbps, 25.000 fps\nAudio:English, AC3, 384kbps\nRuntime: 77mins\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d75bcc9c1ffd0be2570c6c12cede30bc3d7a89","amp;dn":"Ninja.Zombies.2011.DVDrip.XVID-THS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d75bcc9c1ffd0be2570c6c12cede30bc3d7a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,215,91,204,156,31,253,11,226,87,12,108,18,206,222,48,188,61,122,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
