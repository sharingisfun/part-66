PHLAK was created to become the only tool security professionals would need to perform security analysis, penetration testing, forensics, and security auditing. PHLAK comes with two light GUIs (fluxbox and XFCE4), packages for printing, publishing, a little multimedia, many security tools, and a file cabinet full of security related documentation for your reading/educational purposes. This distro is based off of Morphix.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:325989440040580f1f479b459650310ac42d118e","amp;dn":"Linux+-+PHLAK+-+Professional+Hackers+Linux+Assault+Kit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"325989440040580f1f479b459650310ac42d118e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,89,137,68,0,64,88,15,31,71,155,69,150,80,49,10,196,45,17,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
