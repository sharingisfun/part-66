That American Jews influence US foreign policy and that explains America's unwavering support for Israel.\n\nSo what happens if American Jews fall out of love with Israel? That's what the Jewish American academic Norman Finkelstein claims is happening. He says they are now so unhappy with what Israel is doing that they want to distance themselves from the country. \n\nBut then he is nothing if not controversial. He, after all, is famous for accusing Jews of exploiting the Holocaust. And his actions have so incensed Israel it's banned him from entering the country. Could he be right and if he is what does that mean for Middle East policy? \n\nSource: UKNova\nCapper, with thanks: The Eagle \n\nshunster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177904a40580c13aae8ab3b8b97cbaa0b2b27c24","amp;dn":"Norman+Finkelstein+%26ndash%3B+US+Jews+Out+of+Love+with+Israel%3F+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177904a40580c13aae8ab3b8b97cbaa0b2b27c24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,121,4,164,5,128,193,58,174,138,179,184,185,124,186,160,178,178,124,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
