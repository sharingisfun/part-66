This is my first torrent plz give feedback\n\n\nPLEASE SEED.  SHARING IS CARING!  :)\n\n\n&quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;\n\n\nDick forces Kevin Tran, the prophet chosen to read the Word of God to translate the \nWord for him by threatening his mother. Bobby reveals to the Winchesters that the blood of the remaning fallen, the Ruler of Fallen Humanity and a Father of Fallen Beasts refers to Crowley and an Alpha. They summon Crowley, but he refuses to give up his blood until they get the other items needed, directing them to the Alpha Vampire who escaped before Castiel could kill him. Along the way, they learn that the domesticating substance has been added to corn syrup and is now everywhere, with people now acting very dumb. Arriving at the location Crowley gave them, they find a bunch of vampires dead from feeding on infected humans and a young woman named Emily who claims that the Alpha kidnaped her as a little girl. With her help, they locate the Alpha, but leave her and the flask behind as Bobby is showing greater signs of becoming a vengeful spirit. After Emily reveals herself to be a vampire and seeing Dick on TV, Bobby posseses a maid and heads off with the flask to get revenge on Dick. Sam and Dean are captured by the Alpha who refuses to cooperate due to a deal with Dick, but when Edgar arrives, he has them locked up to hear what Edgar has to say. Edgar reveals that the Leviathans have betrayed the vampires and are using the fact that they and other monsters feed on the infected humans to wipe out all monsters. He tries to kill the Alpha, but Sam, having broken free, decapitates Edgar. Grateful to Sam and Dean and recignizing they have a common enemy, the Alpha gives them his blood and they leave only to find Bobby gone and realize he's likely lost to them. Meanwhile, Dick summons Crowley, telling him they have a lot to talk about.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8272aeedf79cb9d9f01778ee904116255c4cf208","amp;dn":"Supernatural+Season+7+episode+22+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8272aeedf79cb9d9f01778ee904116255c4cf208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,114,174,237,247,156,185,217,240,23,120,238,144,65,22,37,92,76,242,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
