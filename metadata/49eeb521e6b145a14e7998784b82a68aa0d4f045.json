In the Second World War Finland was the only nation who brought casualties killed-in-action back to be buried at home. These actions were carried out by men and women working in assembly centres near enemy lines. Silence is a story of a group of people in a limbo between life and death, in a mental no-manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s- land, where heaven and hell, horror and joy, love and fear touch each other.\n\nGenre: Drama | War\nIMDB rating: 6.7/10 from 69 users\nDirected by: Sakari Kirjavainen\nStarring: Joonas Saartamo, Lauri Tilkanen and Joanna Haartti\n\nRelease Name: Silence.2011.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO\nSize: 1.37 GB\nVideo: XviD | 640Ãƒâ€”272 | 1367 kbit/s\nAudio: Finnish | AC-3 | 448 kbit/s\nRuntime: 1h 50mn\nSubtitles: English\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49eeb521e6b145a14e7998784b82a68aa0d4f045","amp;dn":"Silence+2011+DVDRip+XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49eeb521e6b145a14e7998784b82a68aa0d4f045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,238,181,33,230,177,69,161,78,121,152,120,75,130,166,138,160,212,240,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
