We are testing out the new SD.x264 standard on this release. We  \n  think its a great step forward for a scene that is pretty slow to     \n  change, x264 allows for higher quality at similar or less file size.  \n  For regular SD TV (Australia is essentially limited to it) this is a  \n  great chance to squeeze out more quality since we cant do a 720p.     \n  Anyway we hope this release goes well, nuke it and let us know if     \n  there is a problem.                                                   \n                                                                        \n  Frame: 716x394, Avg Vid Bit Rate: 1149 kbps, CRF: 21                  \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;cabdfeaca9b8afbd8aada7aba3a6e4a9a5a7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1adfd4d20c7a3fe6c1770c758e506920caf84a","amp;dn":"The.Straits.S01E05.WS.PDTV.x264-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1adfd4d20c7a3fe6c1770c758e506920caf84a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,26,223,212,210,12,122,63,230,193,119,12,117,142,80,105,32,202,248,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
