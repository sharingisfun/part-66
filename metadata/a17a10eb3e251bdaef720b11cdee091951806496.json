But stalking the depths of its post-nuclear bliss, mass paranoia became fuel for Joseph McCarthyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brand of Red Scare terror propaganda. Bomb shelters were a deluxe feature in every American home, government-sponsored educational reels promised an imminent nuclear threat from across the Atlantic, and Hollywood, Babylon of the western world, hung on the brink of collapse. It was here, in the last-ditch machinations of a dying juggernaut, that a mild-mannered, civil engineerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son would become the most influential force in modern moviemaking. CormanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s World tracks the triumphant rise of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most prolific writer-director-producer, the true godfather of independent filmmaking.\n\nGenre: Documentary\nIMDB rating: 6.7/10 from 161 users\nDirected by: Alex Stapleton\nStarring: Roger Corman, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino\n\nRelease Name: Cormans.World.2011.DVDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-SiC\nSize: 1.4GB\nVideo: XVID, 720Ãƒâ€”400, 1784 Kbps, 23.976 fps\nAudio: English, AC3, 384 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 30m\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a17a10eb3e251bdaef720b11cdee091951806496","amp;dn":"Cormans.World.2011.DVDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-SiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a17a10eb3e251bdaef720b11cdee091951806496","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,122,16,235,62,37,27,218,239,114,11,17,205,238,9,25,81,128,100,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
