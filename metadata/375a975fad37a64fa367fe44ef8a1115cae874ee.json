It is a tactile game, with a focus on making wood and stone look and feel real and believable.\n\nThe highlights of Zen Bound 2 are its controls and its atmosphere. The game teakes full advantage of tilt and multi-touch and feels natural and comfortable to play. The dusty and soothing atmosphere is a combination of beautiful visuals and a unique soundtrack by 'Ghost Monkey'.\nGame Features\nOver 100 levels\nNew gameplay modes with paint bombs\nHighly detailed visuals, gorgeous on the iPad screen, optimized for FullHD and higher resolutions on PC and Mac\nIntuitive and natural multi-touch controls on iOS and Mac(tilt supported)\nNew 'Ghost Monkey' music for a total soundtrack length of 45 minutes\nAll levels from the original Zen Bound, all with visual upgrades, some with new gameplay\nTree of Tribute, featuring guest stars from independently developed iPhone games\n\nPretty graphic intensive game, I recommend a high-end device.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375a975fad37a64fa367fe44ef8a1115cae874ee","amp;dn":"Zen+Bound+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375a975fad37a64fa367fe44ef8a1115cae874ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,90,151,95,173,55,166,79,163,103,254,68,239,138,17,21,202,232,116,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
