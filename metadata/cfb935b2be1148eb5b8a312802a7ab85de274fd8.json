It aired on May 6, 2007, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the disaster. It was commissioned by Channel 4, ZDF, and the Smithsonian Networks to be produced by Pioneer Productions and has also aired on Discovery Channel Canada. Its original working title was Hindenburg and is also known as Hindenburg: Titanic of the skies (which should not be confused with Titanic of the Sky, a different documentary by Vidicom).\n\nIt provides a reenactment of the Hindenburg Disaster using a detailed computer animated model. The animation was done by Red Vision, which also did the animation for two previous documentaries on the Hindenburg Disaster: Hindenburg Disaster: Probable Cause and an episode of Seconds From Disaster. The film also reenacts the investigation of the disaster, which is the main focus of the film. \n\nRead more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg:_The_Untold_Story\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/508/hindenburgtitanicofthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/508/hindenburgtitanicofthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/508/hindenburgtitanicofthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/508/hindenburgtitanicofthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/508/hindenburgtitanicofthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/508/hindenburgtitanicofthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/508/hindenburgtitanicofthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/508/hindenburgtitanicofthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you really need it ...
