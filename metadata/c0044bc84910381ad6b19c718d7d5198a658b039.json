While three soldiers search for a border jumper who, Cinderella-style, has left behind only a single shoe, the camera tracks impassively as their antics become increasingly desperate. A study in juxtaposition and control, The Shoe seems slight at first, but it slowly penetrates, as the simplicity of its construction raises its story to allegorical heights.\n\nThe former documentarianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first feature film is personal. Yet it is bookended by extreme long-shots of the Baltic Sea beach that a surveillance vehicle traverses slowly in opposite directions, and a rigorous formalism mostly pervades the mise-en-scÃƒÂ¨ne: a show of impersonality. Perhaps the key to resolving this paradox is the time in which the film is set: the late 1950sÃ¢â‚¬â€before, that is, Pakalnina herself was born. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“distanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that we detect perhaps corresponds to something of a legendary nature to the story which Pakalnina conjured imaginatively, or heard about, rather than saw unfold. It is a familiar story, after all. The discovery of a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shoe has absurdly led to the single paranoid conclusion that the border has been violated. The foot that fits the shoe must be found. Her Ã¢â‚¬Å“Prince CharmingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ awaits the anonymous CinderellaÃ¢â‚¬â€in this case, in the likely form of a Soviet gulag.\n\nAll the foot-testing with the shoe, here, in the background of the shot, there, in the foreground, sometimes with foot and shoe in closeup, helps convey a dehumanized existence.\n\nAppropriately, the black-and-white film goes on for an hour and a quarter. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long enough.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0044bc84910381ad6b19c718d7d5198a658b039","amp;dn":"The+Shoe+%281998%29+eng+subs+Laila+Pakalnina+%5BKurpe-Russian%2CLatvian%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0044bc84910381ad6b19c718d7d5198a658b039","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,4,75,200,73,16,56,26,214,177,156,113,141,125,81,152,166,88,176,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
