This in itself makes it worth watching at least once to see a Western featuring something other than the ubiquitous 1873 Colt Single Action Army revolver. &quot;Dead Man's Gun&quot; comes off as something bred from old 1950s Western morality series, Richard Boone's repertory series and a large chunk of &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; or &quot;Outer Limits&quot;. Several episodes have a twist at the end with a sting in the tail. Strong stars such as John Ritter,John Glover and producer Henry Winkler turn in fine performances, but maybe the handgun is the real star. The cynical and often sardonic look at human nature may well be accurate but can get one down after a few episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a18b52d7a1c5c89950a1d50fa2275e29e0ed1759","amp;dn":"Dead+Mans+Gun+Season+01+Ep+01+-+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a18b52d7a1c5c89950a1d50fa2275e29e0ed1759","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,139,82,215,161,197,200,153,80,161,213,15,162,39,94,41,224,237,23,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
