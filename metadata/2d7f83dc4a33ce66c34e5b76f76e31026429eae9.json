I tried to open a lemonade stand legally in NYC. That was quite an adventure. It takes 65 days to get permission from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\nWith government adding 80,000 pages of rules and regulations every year, it's no surprise that regular people break laws without even trying.\n\nA small businessman spent 6 years in federal prison for breaking Honduran regulations (and, to make it worse, the Honduran government said he didn't). A family in Idaho can't build a home on their land because the EPA says it's a wetland-but it only resembles a wetland because a government drain malfunctioned and flooded it.\n\nTAXI TROUBLE; ILLEGAL FOOD; ILLEGAL DRUGS; ILLEGAL SEX\n\nOne bit of good news is that while there may be so many laws that no one knows if he's a lawbreaker, it has never been easier to &quot;watch the watchmen.&quot; Tiny cameras in our iPods and cell phones allow citizens to film law enforcement and hold our government accountable. But in the last few years, cops have arrested and jailed people for taping in public. The arrests are not legal, but they happen anyway. Fortunately, arrests are caught on tape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7f83dc4a33ce66c34e5b76f76e31026429eae9","amp;dn":"20120224-Stossel+Special-%5BIllegal+Everything%5D.Fox+News+Channel.C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7f83dc4a33ce66c34e5b76f76e31026429eae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,127,131,220,74,51,206,102,195,78,91,118,247,110,49,2,100,41,234,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
