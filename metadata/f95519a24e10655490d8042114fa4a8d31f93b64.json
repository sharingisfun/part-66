But now that she's made it out of the bloody arena alive, she's still not safe. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge. Who do they think should pay for the unrest? Katniss. And what's worse, President Snow has made it clear that no one else is safe either. Not Katniss's family, not her friends, not the people of District 12. Powerful and haunting, this thrilling final installment of Suzanne Collins's groundbreaking The Hunger Games trilogy promises to be one of the most talked about books of the year.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f95519a24e10655490d8042114fa4a8d31f93b64","amp;dn":"The+Hunger+Games%3A+Mockingjay+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f95519a24e10655490d8042114fa4a8d31f93b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,85,25,162,78,16,101,84,144,216,4,33,20,250,74,141,49,249,59,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
