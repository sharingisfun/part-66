Just how does the \ncuckoo trick other birds into accepting its eggs and raising its young? \nWhy don't the duped foster parents react as they watch the baby cuckoo destroy \ntheir own eggs and chicks? And why do they work so relentlessly to feed a demanding chick that looks nothing like them and will soon dwarf them?\nIn this film, new photography is combined with archive footage and the latest \nscientific findings to solve a puzzle which, as narrator David Attenborough explains, has perplexed nature-watchers for thousands of years.\n\n\nVideo Information:\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 700 MiB\nDuration                                 : 49mn 4s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 993 Kbps\n\n\nVideo:\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nBit rate                                 : 1 867 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio:\n\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                                 : MP3\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 113 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\nFor more BBC Natural World videos visit:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/satishsjp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/satishsjp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bd2437b77a1986a69fb019566a6ced9dbfb830f","amp;dn":"BBC+Natural+World+-+Cuckoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bd2437b77a1986a69fb019566a6ced9dbfb830f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,210,67,123,119,161,152,106,105,251,1,149,102,166,206,217,219,251,131,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
