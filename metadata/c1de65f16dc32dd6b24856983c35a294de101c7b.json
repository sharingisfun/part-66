She's an Englishwoman whose full name is Lori Chacko. She used to employ &quot;Amazon&quot; as her stage name, and she is indeed a sturdy specimen, at 6'1&quot;. But Chacko sings with enough sense of melody and nuance that it would be wrong to categorize her with the rock barbarians. While there's only one slow track on this debut LP, Out of Time (it's about the death of Chacko's mother), it's enough to establish her ability to vary the pace effectively on occasion. Producer Joey Balin keeps the tempo somewhere this side of frenetic and never overwhelms Chacko with technology. Such songs as What's New and Somewhere In Between aren't all that revolutionary, but they aren't really dumb either, and they can be talked overÃƒÂ¹by people with fairly loud voices anywayÃƒÂ¹as well as danced to.
