But they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the same as us.\n\nNow the very latest technology can reveal exactly how they lived, the dangers they faced and the communities they made in the Neander valley in Germany.\n\nWe all know the word Neanderthal to be an unflattering qualifier for some of our more uncultured and dim-witted fellow humans.\n\nBut was the real Neanderthal man truly such an intellectual dunce? The Real Neanderthal Man looks at modern scientific findings that reveal quite the opposite.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c100549d8ed7df9c41cae9ac034030245ea6a6","amp;dn":"The+Real+Neandertal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c100549d8ed7df9c41cae9ac034030245ea6a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,193,0,84,157,142,215,223,156,65,202,233,172,3,64,48,36,94,166,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
