You can use Fedora in addition to, or instead of, other operating systems such as Microsoft WindowsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ or Mac OS XÃ¢â€žÂ¢. The Fedora operating system is completely free of cost for you to enjoy and share.\n\nThe Fedora Project is the name of a worldwide community of people who love, use, and build free software. We want to lead in the creation and spread of free code and content by working together as a community. Fedora is sponsored by Red Hat, the world's most trusted provider of open source technology. Red Hat invests in Fedora to encourage collaboration and incubate innovative new free software technologies.\n\n\nWhat makes Fedora different?\n\nWe believe in the value of free software, and fight to protect and promote solutions anyone can use and redistribute. Not only is the Fedora operating system made from free software, but we use free software exclusively to provide it to you. This web site, in fact, is made from free software and serves millions of people every month.\n\nWe also believe in the power of collaboration. Our developers work with free software project teams around the world we call &quot;upstream.&quot; They create much of the software found in Fedora. We collaborate closely with them so everyone can benefit from our work, and get access to improvements as soon as possible. By working in the same direction as these project teams, we can ensure that free software works better together, and provides the best experience for users. We also can include improvements quickly, which helps not only users, but the upstream as well.\n\nWe also believe in empowering others to pursue their own visions of a free operating system. Anyone can remix Fedora into a new product with a new name. We even provide the tools in Fedora itself. In fact, Fedora is already the foundation for derivatives such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the One Laptop Per Child XO, and the Creative Commons Live Content DVDs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e71aa437b8da753c04ac230de1e07aa7946f18","amp;dn":"Fedora+16+Source+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e71aa437b8da753c04ac230de1e07aa7946f18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,231,26,164,55,184,218,117,60,4,172,35,13,225,224,122,167,148,111,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
