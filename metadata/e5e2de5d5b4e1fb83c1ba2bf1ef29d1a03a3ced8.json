Working eboot already installed. Just download and play!\n\nI had hard time trying to find a &quot;working+no stupid password bullshit&quot; -torrent for Saints Row: The Third. After nitpicking from the depths of internet, I finally had a complete and working copy of the game--and now you do aswell!\n\nWhat to do:\n\n1. Get a true blue dongle/clone, then install it.\n2. Download and unrar (use winrar if you don't have any program(s) to unrar)\n2. Transfer &quot;BLES01342-[saintsrow3]&quot; directory to your PS3's internal harddrive (don't know if external works); if you use multiman FTP/transfer to dev_hdd0GAMES\n3. Play &amp; thank me in your mind.\n4.
