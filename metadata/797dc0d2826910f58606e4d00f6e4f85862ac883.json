Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as I have over 70 torrents that I try to keep alive and seed for you all.\n\n\n\nI noticed requests for subtitles and the extras from the DVD, so here I present this film with embedded English (sorry, only English subtitles were on the DVD) subtitles and the &quot;extras&quot; from the DVD. Enjoy!\n\n\n\nOn a Friday night after a drunken house party with his straight mates, Russell heads out to a gay club, alone and on the pull. Just before closing time he picks up Glen but what's expected to be just a one-night stand becomes something else, something special. That weekend, in bars and in bedrooms, getting drunk and taking drugs, telling stories and having sex, the two men get to know each other. It is a brief encounter that will resonate throughout their lives. Weekend is both an honest and unapologetic love story between two guys and a film about the universal struggle for an authentic life in all its forms. It is about the search for identity and the importance of making a passionate commitment to your life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797dc0d2826910f58606e4d00f6e4f85862ac883","amp;dn":"Weekend+%282011%29+w%2FEnglish+subs+%26amp%3B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797dc0d2826910f58606e4d00f6e4f85862ac883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,125,192,210,130,105,16,245,134,6,228,208,15,110,79,133,134,42,200,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
