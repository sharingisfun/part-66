DiskWarrior is so advanced it can even recover your data from a failing hard drive. Yet all that power is hidden behind one button.\n\nDiskWarrior cures those cryptic errors reported by Disk Utility.\n\nMessages from your Mac such as &quot;Invalid node structure&quot; and &quot;Keys out of order&quot; may seem mysterious or even scary but DiskWarrior fixes these problems and many, many more.\n\nDiskWarrior uses a different approach to disk directory repair than other programs.\n\nDiskWarrior is not a disk repair program in the conventional sense. Instead of patching the original directory, it uses a patent-pending technology to quickly build a new replacement directory using data recovered from the original directory, thereby recovering files, folders and documents that you thought were lost and that no other program could recover.\n\nHow does DiskWarrior recover data no one else can?\n\nAt Alsoft, we know that the most important thing when you are attempting to repair your disks is getting your data back. That's why the first thing DiskWarrior does is scavenge your original directory to find all the file data it can. It then uses this data to build an entirely new replacement directory.\n\nDiskWarrior is the only product that finds all of your data.\n\nIts patent-pending method always results in a perfectly rebuilt directory without any errors and that contains all of your file and folder data.\n\nDiskWarrior is the highest rated and wins more awards.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨The reviews are in! See what the press is already saying about the new DiskWarrior 4.\n\nCan you afford to waste your hard-earned money on any other utility?\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨You can try other utilities but you'll probably end up needing DiskWarrior to recover your data.You'll save money buying DiskWarrior first.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Intel/PPC Mac OS X 10.3.9 through 10.7 with at least 512 MB RAM\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:265d1ddfb1c0db20316e7ab44fa25d5f13b168d2","amp;dn":"DiskWarrior+v.4.4+Boot+Disk+%5BK%5Bracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"265d1ddfb1c0db20316e7ab44fa25d5f13b168d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,93,29,223,177,192,219,32,49,110,122,180,79,162,93,95,19,177,104,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
