The pattern was available on the website for years, but due to programming changes and lack of web updating, most of the pages either no longer exist or have broken links, making it impossible to complete the pattern. I have seen many people posting, looking for the pattern.  Look no more!! I made my own from these files.\n\nThis file contains all the pages needed to complete this quilt as well as the individual patterns.  It can be done by an experienced beginner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4bc3b045f246c00cdf076322677af720cca88d","amp;dn":"HGTV+Houses+Strolling+the+Block","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d4bc3b045f246c00cdf076322677af720cca88d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,75,195,176,69,242,70,192,12,223,7,99,34,103,122,247,32,204,168,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
