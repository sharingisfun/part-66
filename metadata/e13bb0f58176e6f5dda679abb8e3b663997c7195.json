The film is based on the 2006 graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. The main plot revolves around an amnesiac outlaw (Craig), a wealthy cattleman (Ford), and a mysterious traveler (Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople abducted by aliens. The screenplay was written by Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Mark Fergus, and Hawk Ostby, based on a story by the latter two along with Steve Oedekerk. The film was produced by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Kurtzman, Lindelof, Orci, and Rosenberg, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer.\n\nThe project began development in 1997, when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks bought film rights to a concept pitched by Rosenberg, former president at Malibu Comics, which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of $163 million, filming for Cowboys &amp; Aliens began in June 2010, in New Mexico and California. Despite studio pressure to release the film in 3-D, Favreau chose to film traditionally and in anamorphic format (widescreen picture on standard 35 mm film) to further a &quot;classic movie feel&quot;.[4] Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's &quot;inherently comic&quot; title and premise.[5] The film's aliens were designed to be &quot;cool and captivating&quot;,[6] with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place.\n\nCowboys &amp; Aliens premiered at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on July 29, 2011. The film, though having grossed its budget back, is considered to be a financial disappointment, taking $174.8 million in box office receipts on a $163 million budget. Cowboys &amp; Aliens received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting but critical of its blend of the Western and science fiction genres.\n\nAfter its release, a lawsuit was filed against those involved in the development of the film by Steven John Busti, who claimed that the film infringed the copyright of his own similarly themed work written in 1994.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e13bb0f58176e6f5dda679abb8e3b663997c7195","amp;dn":"Cowboys+And+Aliens+2011+EXTENDED+1080p+BRRip+Dual+Audio%5BHindi%2BEn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e13bb0f58176e6f5dda679abb8e3b663997c7195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,59,176,245,129,118,230,245,221,166,121,171,184,227,182,99,153,124,113,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
