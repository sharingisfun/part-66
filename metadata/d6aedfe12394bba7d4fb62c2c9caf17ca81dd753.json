Every night, the same number of beasts. The two men conclude that there's a connection to their Israeli Army mission in the first Lebanon War of the early eighties. Ari is surprised that he can't remember a thing anymore about that period of his life. Intrigued by this riddle, he decides to meet and interview old friends and comrades around the world. He needs to discover the truth about that time and about himself. As Ari delves deeper and deeper into the mystery, his memory begins to creep up in surreal images.\n\nRuntime:90 min \n\nLanguage:Hebrew","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6aedfe12394bba7d4fb62c2c9caf17ca81dd753","amp;dn":"Waltz.with.Bashir.2008.NO.FI.DVDR-ZORT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6aedfe12394bba7d4fb62c2c9caf17ca81dd753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,174,223,225,35,148,187,167,212,251,98,194,201,202,241,124,168,29,215,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
