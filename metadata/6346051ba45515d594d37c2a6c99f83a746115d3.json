Spaceballs is a spoof of the Star Wars and Star Trek franchise \n\nSynopsis\n\nKing Roland of the planet Druidia is trying to marry his daughter Princess Vespa to Prince Valium, but Vespa is kidnapped by the evil race of the Spaceballs. The Spaceballs ask Roland a tremendous ransom: all the air of Druidia (you see, the air of Spaceball had serious pollution problems...). The King decides to offer a generous amount of money to a space rogue, Lone Starr, to persuade him to save Vespa. What follows is the parody of a _LOT_ of famous SF movies.\n\nActors\n\nMel Brooks as President Skroob / Yogurt\n\nJohn Candy as Barf\n\nRick Moranis as Dark Helmet\n\nBill Pullman as Lone Star\n\nDaphne Zuniga as Princess Vespa\n\nDick Van Patten as King Roland\n\nGeorge Wyner as Colonel Sandurz\n\nMichael Winslow as Radar Technician\n\nJoan Rivers as Dot Matrix (voice)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6346051ba45515d594d37c2a6c99f83a746115d3","amp;dn":"Spaceballs%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6346051ba45515d594d37c2a6c99f83a746115d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,70,5,27,164,85,21,213,148,211,124,42,108,153,248,58,116,97,21,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
