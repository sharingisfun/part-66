I put this together November 12, 2008 and just made the ISO again from a DVD-R which I had burnt back then. I also burnt anther DVD-R today to verify the ISO and resulting DVD work OK. They do. The main features are excellent productions which were made for TV in Australia and the UK. Picture and sound are excellent for them. While the menu shows four there are seven separate items.\n1- Die Deutsche Wochenschau Nr 516 (1940-07-27) \nThis is an episode of the wartime German news series. Here we see their conquests almost at their peak. With the defeat of France only Great Britain and the Commonwealth remained to try to stop them from finally wining the war that was started in 1914. This starts with their a review of their Italian allies, the British Empire and then goes to the major Victory celebrations in Berlin. These were their happy times...one year before the disastrous decision to attack the USSR without defeating Britain first. This is original which is to say in German without subtitles.                                               Length: 21:28\n2- The Wehrmacht  Nr 4 - Resistance\nThis recounts several attempts to change the doomed path Germany was on after 1941 in particular. This usually meant trying to assassinate A.Hitler. Veterans recount their thoughts. Some like most thought nothing could be done...the machinery of the police state was too powerful. Others did what they could and tell about their tiny acts of resistance. If a German soldier refused to fight...they faced terrible consequences...a veteran recounts an instance. Recently de-classified documents have been made available in the UK. As the war went on the British had a growing number of captured German generals whom they kept in relative comfort in a large estate. The building was thoroughly wired to secretly record their private talks with each other. It was a big job since the generals talked all the time. This gave great insight then and now into the thinking of such people regarding their support of the Fuhrer or lack there of. Ordinary soldiers sometimes came into knowing firsthand of the terrible persecution of Jews, Bolsheviks, Gypsies etc that fanatical death squads were doing. While we know nobody succeeded in killing Hitler this episode still reveals things many don't know and should.                        Length: 52:26\n3- Private Snafu - Booby Traps\nAn American wartime cartoon from 1944 which while being amusing, is dealing with the very real dangers of Booby Traps left possibly anywhere by the enemy.                                            Length: 04:18\n4- Sex Bomb\nThis is WW2 fought with printing presses and radio transmissions. By propaganda and false information. As the war progresses so too does the nastiness of this way of fighting the enemy for both sides. Truth is used too at times when the enemy can be reminded of bombing back home or that maybe their girlfriends and wives may be screwing around while they are gone.                           Length: 48:35\n5- The Autobiography of a Jeep\nShort film from 1943 which tells the story of the indispensable Jeep as told by one.          Length: 09:32\n6- The Wehrmacht  Nr 5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ To the Bitter End\nWhy did they not surrender long before Germany itself was almost totally taken in May 1945? Well we know why the leaders who would be held responsible didn't want to. But why didn't soldiers in mass just surrender in the field as early as 1943? Once again the German perspective on this is secretly listened to when the captured generals talk about such things. There were as many victims in the last ten months of the war as there had been in the previous five years. There were the new wonder weapons which may have changed things earlier in the war, but still the war was lost perhaps as early as the end of 1941.                                                                                                                 Length: 52:17\n7- SU-35/37 Multirole Fighter.\nA short film promotion of the Sukhoi design bureaus large strategic jet fighter showing how with its' thrust vectoring exhaust nozzles it can do some amazing manoeuvres.
