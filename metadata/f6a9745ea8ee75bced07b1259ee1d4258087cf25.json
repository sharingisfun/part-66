We otherwise have only a superficial benefit from its use and even a\ndetraction from or negation of what is its true intent.\n\nI hope that Europe will adopt the right use of the English language as the\nstandard - after it has found a way to retain its spirit where it is best found\nto still exist - (in Germany Sweden Holland etc) as this movie tells us that\nThe British paid too high a price to attain what is their expertise on the\nrelative quickness of the uptake as it were.\n\nYet for me personally, none will ever be as much of who I am or my real true\nfamily- other than what is to come perhaps that tries to be as good in this regard\n\nsusbtitles included for French and Spanish  along with an English template for\nconversion to all other subtitle languages not already found on the net for this\nmost important motion picture\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\nPS Dont miss out on Carrington (1995) starring too, our dear Ms. Emma Thompson\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6a9745ea8ee75bced07b1259ee1d4258087cf25","amp;dn":"The+Remains+of+the+day+%281993%29+H.264+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+1GB+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6a9745ea8ee75bced07b1259ee1d4258087cf25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,169,116,94,168,238,117,188,237,7,177,37,158,225,212,37,128,135,207,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
