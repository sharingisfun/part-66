Initially armed only with a knife and a Walther P38 (obtained by overpowering the guard in his cell), B.J. tries to escape the castle prison. Taking on SS guards, he eventually finds himself face to face with head prison guard Hans Grosse.\n\nIn the second episode, Operation: Eisenfaust, B.J. finds out that the operation is real, and that Nazis are creating an army of undead mutants in Castle Hollehammer. B.J. enters the castle and confronts the mad scientist Dr. Schabbs, creator of the mutants. His defeat signals the end of this biological war.\n\nDie, FÃƒÂ¼hrer, Die! is, chronologically, the final episode. Fighting through Nazi soldiers, and attacking the bunker under the Reichstag, he finds himself up against Adolf Hitler, who is equipped with a robotic suit and four chainguns.\n\n&quot;The Nocturnal Missions&quot; form a prequel storyline, focusing on the Germans' plans for chemical warfare (Giftkrieg). A Dark Secret deals with the initial pursuit of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry; B.J.'s task is to enter the weapons research facility and hunt down another mad scientist, Dr. Otto Giftmacher (Poison Maker).\n\nTrail of the Madman takes place in Castle Erlangen. B.J.'s goal is to find the maps and plans of the chemical war, guarded by Gretel Grosse (Hans' sister).\n\nThe story comes to a close in Confrontation, set in Castle Offenbach. The final battle is fought between B.J. and the leader of the chemical war initiative, General Fettgesicht (Fat Face).\n\nPlay in Windows itÃ‚Â´s compatible!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:338e87549ce6b7e4cb22801831401ff02a19b7ed","amp;dn":"Wolf3d_PC-DOS_win.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"338e87549ce6b7e4cb22801831401ff02a19b7ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,142,135,84,156,230,183,228,203,34,128,24,49,64,31,240,42,25,183,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
