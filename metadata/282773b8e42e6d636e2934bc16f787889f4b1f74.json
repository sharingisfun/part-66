Not as a murder suspect, but as a clairvoyant. Many of the towns folk go to Annabelle for help, and Jessica's fiancÃƒÂ©e, Wayne Collins, turns to Annabelle for possible guidance. Annabelle feels that she can't help, but this doesn't stop her from constantly getting visions of Jessica's fate.\n\nAudio: English.\nSubs.: English.\n\n Please seed after downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:282773b8e42e6d636e2934bc16f787889f4b1f74","amp;dn":"The+Gift+-+DVDR+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"282773b8e42e6d636e2934bc16f787889f4b1f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,39,115,184,228,46,109,99,110,41,52,188,22,247,135,136,159,75,31,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
