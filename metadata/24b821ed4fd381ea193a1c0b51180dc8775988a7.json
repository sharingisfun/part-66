With WinAMP, it is possible to listen to SHOUTcast streaming radio broadcasts. The program allows the user to convert audio from analog tape recorders, phonographs, and other media to MP3 digital format, and it allows the user to burn MP3 files onto CDs. WinAMP can be configured to periodically scan folders on a computer hard drive for new media.\n\n\n\nWinAMP includes various skins (graphical user interface designs) from which to choose. Users can design their own skins and publish them at the WinAMP Web site. A Macintosh version of the program, called MacAMP, is available.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24b821ed4fd381ea193a1c0b51180dc8775988a7","amp;dn":"Winamp+Pro+5.58+Build+2975+Final+%2B+Serial+%7EBLS%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24b821ed4fd381ea193a1c0b51180dc8775988a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,184,33,237,79,211,129,234,25,58,28,11,81,24,13,200,119,89,136,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
