The mod uses many of the original graphics to make it look very similar to the original game and the many added and improved graphics mean it in fact looks even better than the original.\nThere are 2 game modes:\nClassic: the intend of this game mode is to replicate Tiberian Dawn's gameplay as closely as possible.\nEnhanced: as the name implies, the intend of this game mode is to further &quot;enhance&quot; the game by improving the game balance and adding many new units, buildings and weapons.\nView this video to see many of the features this version of DTA has to offer:\nAs you can see in the video, installing the mod is just a matter of placing the launcher in an empty folder, starting it and clicking a button and playing online is just as simple; just click the 'Play on CnCNet' button, chose whether to play in Classic or Enhanced mode and you're there.\nAnd if you take a look at CnCNet's statistics you'll see that DTA (the green line) often has has some players online, so finding other players to play with usually shouldn't be too difficult.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b71e9d00f42fdfd27fbf8434fe41f3b76c07c61","amp;dn":"Command+%26amp%3B+Conquer+Gold+%26quot%3BThe+Dawn+of+the+Tiberium+Age%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b71e9d00f42fdfd27fbf8434fe41f3b76c07c61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,113,233,208,15,66,253,253,39,251,248,67,79,228,31,59,118,192,124,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
