It demonstrates that la belle ÃƒÂ©poque was less belle for the girls than for their wealthy clients, though better than walking the streets or working in a sweatshop. The film is superbly designed to suggest the oppressive, hypocritical haut-bourgeois decor, the obsessive eroticism that excludes real desire, and the languorous timelessness that makes one day like another. There is enough detail about money, cosmetics, hygiene, sexually transmitted diseases, theatrical deportment and authentic camaraderie to qualify the film as a kind of documentary. But a final coda offering a glimpse of whores in present-day Paris, waiting in the streets for passing motorists to pick them up, shows that plus ÃƒÂ§a change, plus cÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est le mÃƒÂªme commerce. The movieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most startling image is of an abused, once beautiful prostitute who imagines her clientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sperm turning into tears and flowing from her eyes.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 7.3/10\nDirected by: Bertrand Bonello\nStarring: Hafsia Herzi, CÃƒÂ©line Sallette and Jasmine Trinca\n\nRelease Name: House.Of.Tolerance.2011.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-LPD\nSize: 2cd\nVideo: XviD | 640Ãƒâ€”336 | 1084 kb/s\nAudio: French | AC3 | 448 kb/s\nSubtitles: English/Spanish\nRuntime: 2h 5mn \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf00e6ca40c427a5615b38b64f080d9d16b44fc","amp;dn":"House+Of+Tolerance+2011+LiMiTED+DVDRip+XviD-LPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf00e6ca40c427a5615b38b64f080d9d16b44fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,240,14,108,164,12,66,122,86,21,179,139,100,240,128,217,209,107,68,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
