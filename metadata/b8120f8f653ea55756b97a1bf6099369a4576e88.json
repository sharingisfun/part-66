Set in a flooded, post-apocalyptic world, the game consists of players fighting over control of the world's last remaining oil reserves.\n\nThe game combines classic elements of strategy and tower defense as players must defend and attack oil rigs through the use of armed platforms against hordes of enemy watercraft and other attack units. The campaign's story puts the player in the shoes of Kevin, a graduate of the military academy and disciple of The Commander in a story-driven succession, while multiplayer allows players to go head-to-head against friends or online opponents in a strategic manner. Players are forced to maintain, upgrade, defend, and attack oil rigs put in various locations on each map.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8120f8f653ea55756b97a1bf6099369a4576e88","amp;dn":"Oil+Rush","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8120f8f653ea55756b97a1bf6099369a4576e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,18,15,143,101,62,165,87,86,185,122,27,246,9,147,105,164,87,110,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
