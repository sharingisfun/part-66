From Sea Fishing, River Fishing and Fishery locations we go through all kinds of weather and use every fishing trick in the book to complete the challenge.\n\nJoin us on our adventure and pick up all our top tips.\\&quot;\n\n\nAnyone who loves fishing will love this! I have 10Mbit upload so don\\'t worry that 5 dvds is such a lot, it\\'ll be seeded fully.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nIf anyone can help me out I have two fishing requests that I\\'ve never been able to get filled:\n\n\n1. Matt Hayes: Buena Vista Fishing Club\nTen-part series filmed in Cuba which sees me travel across the whole country in an old Lada with a fishing rod for company. The programme\\'s show what a great place to fish Cuba really is.\n\n\n\n2. Jeremy Wade: Jungle Hooks Amazonian Giant\nSeries where Jeremy travels from Brazil in 2002, includes him surviving a plane crash and being persuaded to compete in a local fishing competition while he tries to catch a giant arapaima.\n\n\nSeen both of these myself but my wife hasn\\'t and we fish together these days If anyone can share them here that\\'d be great, or if they prefer to share privately I can then share here myself.\n\n***********************************************************************************\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7ff41a1baa9f0c802e0e51e63bac2580cf30db2","amp;dn":"%5BFishing%5D+The+Greater+Rod+Race+DVD+5+of+5+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7ff41a1baa9f0c802e0e51e63bac2580cf30db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,255,65,161,186,169,240,200,2,224,229,30,99,186,194,88,12,243,13,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
