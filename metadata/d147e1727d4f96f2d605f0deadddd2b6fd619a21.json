The forum became inactive about 3 months ago due to the end of Code Lyoko and the staff decided to close shop. The song's origins was a short demo in Lyoko Computer's forum signature, which he has had for as long as I can remember. Whenever this song is played, I think of him and TL. This is reason to why I decided to put the full version for you all to listen to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d147e1727d4f96f2d605f0deadddd2b6fd619a21","amp;dn":"Code+Lyoko+Remixed+Project+Super+Nova","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d147e1727d4f96f2d605f0deadddd2b6fd619a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,71,225,114,125,79,150,242,214,5,240,222,173,221,210,182,253,97,154,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
