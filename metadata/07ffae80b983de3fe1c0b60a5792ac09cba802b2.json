We really do experience something of what it was like to live through those terrifying days of the London Blitz, and the mysteries themselves are good also.\n\nThe sympathetic portrayal of the lives and customs of the people rings true, and all in all this is a most satisfying mystery series.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07ffae80b983de3fe1c0b60a5792ac09cba802b2","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Francis+Hancock+Mystery+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07ffae80b983de3fe1c0b60a5792ac09cba802b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,255,174,128,185,131,222,63,225,192,182,10,87,146,172,9,203,168,2,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
