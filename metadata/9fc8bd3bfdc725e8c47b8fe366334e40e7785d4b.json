We have done a huge amount of work fixing bugs from RC1 and on end-user home made tools such as TazPKG, TazPanel and TazUSB. Wifi connection is made easier via TazPanel or the new wifibox. TazPKG has better desktop integration and a new notification system.\nThis new version comes with a full Xorg package and DRI support as well as the nv, intel, geode and vesa drivers working out-of-the-box. We have also rebuilt all packages once again and saved ~2Mb in the core LiveCD, so we now include Lxrandr, Parcellite and the transmission BiTorrent client.\nWe want to thank everyone who tested the first release candidate; this RC2 is close to the upcoming SliTaz 4.0 version planned in 2 weeks.
