Every time I see Dan Duryea in a movie, I always remember the movie &quot;Chicago Calling&quot;. If I remember correctly, I first saw the movie in the late 50's; and being ten or eleven years old, was very sad to see a father trying so hard to get his phone back on so as to be able to get word from his wife, that she and their son were going to be okay after a car accident. The accident with the little dog made it even sadder. It's nice to know, though, that there are good people working for the telephone company, as was the character that played the part of the telephone man sent to disconnect the phone, but is nice enough to make sure a man waiting for a call from a loved one that was involved in an accident, is given an an opportunity to connect and not be disconnected, like what happens to many of us when we are late in paying our telephone bill. Gee, I really would like to see this movie again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc74732542e03965bd98caeedfe52f79ee3ac719","amp;dn":"Chicago+Calling+%281952%29+75+min.Dan+Duryea.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc74732542e03965bd98caeedfe52f79ee3ac719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,116,115,37,66,224,57,101,189,152,202,238,223,229,47,121,238,58,199,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
