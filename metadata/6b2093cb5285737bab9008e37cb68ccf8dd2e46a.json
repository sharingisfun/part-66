Suppose you saw a friend's spouse cheating -- would you tell her? What if you saw a young girl being cruelly taunted by other girls - would you confront them? Using hidden cameras, ''Primetime: What Would You Do?'' sets up everyday scenarios and then captures people's reactions. Whether they're compelled to act or mind their own business, John Quinones reports on their split-second - and often surprising - decision-making process.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2093cb5285737bab9008e37cb68ccf8dd2e46a","amp;dn":"what.would.you.do.2012-02-10.pray.the.gay.away.hdtv.xvid-cldd.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2093cb5285737bab9008e37cb68ccf8dd2e46a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,32,147,203,82,133,115,123,171,144,8,227,124,182,140,207,141,210,228,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
