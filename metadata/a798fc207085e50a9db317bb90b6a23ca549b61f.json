Lauded as Downbeat MagazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s #2 rising star, up-and-comer Christian Howes has wowed fellow performers and audiences alike with his explosive violin stylings, uncanny improvisations and a remarkable stage presence that has caused him to be called the &quot;Jazz Paganini.&quot; \nChristian Howes is just beginning to cast his signature sound and indelible echo onto the world of Jazz.
