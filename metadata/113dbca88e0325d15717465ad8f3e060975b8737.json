NFO .............\n-NYC.22.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION\nAired 15.04.2012\n\n&quot;Pilot&quot;\n\nNYC 22 follows six diverse NYPD \nrookies as they patrol the gritty \nstreets of upper Manhattan. The new \ntrainees include Jennifer &quot;White \nHouse&quot; Perry, a former college \nvolleyball star and Marine MP in Iraq \nwith a take-charge attitude; Ray \n&quot;Lazarus&quot; Harper, the oldest rookie \nand a former police news reporter \nwith better sources than most \nseasoned cops; Tonya Sanchez, who \ncomes from a family with a criminal \nhistory; Ahmad Kahn, an Afghani \nnative who fought his way to freedom; \nKenny McClaren, a fourth-generation \npolice officer with great instincts \nbut qualms about joining the force; \nand Jayson &quot;Jackpot&quot; Toney, a young \nbasketball legend who squandered his\nopportunity in the NBA. Their \ndemanding Field Training Officer, \nDaniel &quot;Yoda&quot; Dean, is a case-\nhardened, unsentimental veteran of \nthe force who emphasizes basics and \nholds each cop accountable for their \nactions. Rounding out the team is\nSergeant Terry Howard, a no-nonsense \nplainclothes officer from the Gang \nIntel Unit, who trains the rookies on \nhow to keep the gangbangers at bay. \nWith unique backgrounds, \npersonalities and reasons for being \non the force, the new cops will make \ntheir share of rookie mistakes while \nthey figure out how to relate to \ntheir boss, each other and the people \nthey swore to protect. \n\n18/Slower+\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)\nmadcow at hushmail dot com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:113dbca88e0325d15717465ad8f3e060975b8737","amp;dn":"NYC.22.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"113dbca88e0325d15717465ad8f3e060975b8737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,61,188,168,142,3,37,209,87,23,70,90,216,243,224,96,151,91,135,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
