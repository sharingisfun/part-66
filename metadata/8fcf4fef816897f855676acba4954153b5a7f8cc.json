P. Cahn, who ran a so-called exposÃƒÂ© on ScullyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sources. \nSince then however, there has been a train of thought that the exposÃƒÂ© was possibly engineered by the US Military Establishment because Scully was getting being near to the truth about saucer retrieval.  \nWhatever oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opinions are, this book is still an entertaining read about the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgolden ageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of UFOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from ArnoldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1947 sighting to the early 1950Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s when the USAF were literally floundering in what response to give to the publicÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..something that some believe is still the case today.\n\nI downloaded this as a word document from the internet and cleaned up, I hope, the spelling, grammar and formatting to make it as good as the original book was, and then converted it using Calibre into epub and PDF formats.\nPlease seed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Scully&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Scully&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fcf4fef816897f855676acba4954153b5a7f8cc","amp;dn":"%3DRare+UFO+book.+Frank+Scully+-+Behind+the+Flying+Saucers+%281950%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fcf4fef816897f855676acba4954153b5a7f8cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,207,79,239,129,104,151,248,85,103,106,203,164,149,65,83,181,167,248,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
