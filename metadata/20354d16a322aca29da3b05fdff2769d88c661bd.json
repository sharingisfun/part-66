The daughter's strange relationship with the gas mask her shellshocked military father left behind fuels a grave chain reaction. \n\nGas Mask is a highly-stylized, uncompromising series of dystopian snapshots leading up to the fall of New York City. The story is told through the final days of a crew of sadistic gangsters, a bizarre little girl, a delusional government agent, a famous photographer, a notorious murderer, an unbreakable mother, a master tailor, a shifty graffiti artist, a fiendish cop, a hungry city councilman, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nI uploaded a mobi of Gas Mask in the last noir pack, but by mistake it was an early edit. This should have less errors for those that enjoy the book and want a cleaner copy.\n\nIf you like this book please review it on Amazon and Goodreads, so more readers will give it a chance.\n\nThx.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20354d16a322aca29da3b05fdff2769d88c661bd","amp;dn":"Gas+Mask+for+Kindle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20354d16a322aca29da3b05fdff2769d88c661bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,53,77,22,163,34,172,162,157,163,176,95,223,242,118,157,136,198,97,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
