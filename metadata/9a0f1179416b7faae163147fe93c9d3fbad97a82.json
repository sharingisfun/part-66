John Fords smash hit and enduring masterpiece Stagecoach revolutionized the western, elevating it from B movie to the A-list and establishing the genre as we know it today. The quintessential tale of a group of strangers thrown together into extraordinary circumstances, Stagecoach features outstanding performances from Hollywood stalwarts Claire Trevor, John Carradine, and Thomas Mitchell, and, of course, John Wayne, in his first starring role for Ford, as the daredevil outlaw the Ringo Kid. Superbly shot and tightly edited, Stagecoach (Fords first trip to Monument Valley) is Hollywood storytelling at its finest.\n\nFilm Essays: \nStagecoach: Taking the Stage By David Cairns &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1472-stagecoach-taking-the-stage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1472-stagecoach-taking-the-stage&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*** THE BEST WAY TO MESSAGE ME IS TO COMMENT ON MY LATEST UPLOAD, I AM GETTING TOO MANY UP THERE TO MONITOR ALL OF THEM. ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0f1179416b7faae163147fe93c9d3fbad97a82","amp;dn":"Stagecoach+%281939%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29+2+Disc+Criterion+Collection+NTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0f1179416b7faae163147fe93c9d3fbad97a82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,15,17,121,65,107,127,170,225,99,20,127,233,60,157,63,186,217,122,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
