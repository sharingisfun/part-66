In this version, musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) lose their jobs when a speakeasy owned by mob boss Spats Columbo (George Raft) is raided by prohibition agent Mulligan (Pat O'Brien). Several weeks later, on February 14th, Joe and Jerry get a job perfroming in Urbana and end up witnessing a gangland massacre in a parking garage. Fearing that they will be next on the mobsters' hit lists, Joe devises an ingenious plan for disguising their identities. Soon they are all dolled up and performing as Josephine and Daphne in Sweet Sue's all-girl orchestra. En route to Florida by train with Sweet Sue's band, the boys (girls?) make the acquaintance of Sue's lead singer Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe, in what may be her best performance). Joe and Jerry immediately fall in love, though of course their new feminine identities prevent them from acting on their desires. Still, they are determined to woo her, and they enact an elaborate series of gender-bending ruses complicated by the fact that flirtatious millionaire Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown) has fallen in love with &quot;Daphne.&quot; The plot gets even thicker when Spats Columbo and his boys show up in Florida. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Some.Like.It.Hot.1959.720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-WiKi.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 6.56 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Overall bit rate : 7 724 Kbps\n      Encoded date : UTC 2011-05-03 08:25:56\n      Writing application : mkvmerge v2.2.0 ('Turn It On Again') built on Mar  4 2008 12:58:26\n      Writing library : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Video Codec     \n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate : 5 868 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 6 016 Kbps\n      Width : 1 192 pixels\n      Height : 720 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.656\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.285\n      Stream size : 4.98 GiB (76%)\n      Writing library : x264 core 98 r1649 c54c47d\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : DTS\n      Format/Info : Digital Theater Systems\n      Codec ID : A_DTS\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 1 510 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Stream size : 1.28 GiB (20%)\n      Language : English\n   Audio #3\n      ID : 3\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Format profile : Dolby Digital\n      Codec ID : A_AC3\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 167 MiB (2%)\n      Language : Chinese\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053291/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053291/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English or Chinese\nSubtitles: Portuguese (srt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a2848d3de2f31f5ffc7c9861e21cf1ae69ec5c","amp;dn":"Some.Like.It.Hot.1959.720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-WiKi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a2848d3de2f31f5ffc7c9861e21cf1ae69ec5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,162,132,141,61,226,243,31,95,252,124,152,97,226,28,241,174,105,236,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
