Kirk's hoping to go back to the newly created Genesis planet where he laid Mr. Spock to rest. But upon arriving he is told that the Enterprise will not be repaired and that Genesis has become a delicate matter and until it's resolved, no one is allowed to go there or talk about it. McCoy is also acting strangely. Later when he starts talking about Genesis he is detained. Kirk is visited by Spock's father Sarek, who tells him that he betrayed Spock because being placed on Genesis was not what he would have wanted. He tells Kirk he's supposed to bring Spock's body along with his soul or katra as the Vulcans call it which he passes onto someone, and bring it to Vulcan for the final rites. Sarek assumes Kirk would have it but he doesn't ..\n\nTechnical data file:\nQuality: HDRip\nFormat: MKV\nVideo Codec: x264\nAudio codec: AAC\nVideo: 940 x 400, 23.976 fps, 465 Kbps,\nAudio # 1: English, original, 48.100 kHz, AAC, 2 ch, ~ 128.00 kbps VBR\nAudio # 2: Russian, 48.100 kHz, AAC, 2 ch, ~ 128.00 kbps VBR\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pics.kz/v/1eAY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pics.kz/v/1eAY&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pics.kz/v/1eAZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pics.kz/v/1eAZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pics.kz/v/1eB0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pics.kz/v/1eB0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pics.kz/v/1eB1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pics.kz/v/1eB1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31452d57879e95929386c4bdd24428e9f5beba4f","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+03+The+Search+for+Spock+%5B1984%5D+HDRip+%5BEng+Rus%5D+Junoon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31452d57879e95929386c4bdd24428e9f5beba4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,69,45,87,135,158,149,146,147,134,196,189,210,68,40,233,245,190,186,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
