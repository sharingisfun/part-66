On the evening of Thursday 19th July 1973 in the \nintimate surrounds of Ebbets Field in Colorado, Little Feat played two shows, \nwith the team from KCUV FM on hand to broadcast both. The two sets performed \nfeatured similar track-lists, and while this CD features the late show in its entirety, \nas a bonus the three tracks from the earlier performances that weren t played again, \nare also included here.
