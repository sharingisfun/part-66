Three weeks later, James Marshall, the President of the United States, gives a speech at a state dinner in Moscow, telling the world that they will no longer negotiate with terrorists. Afterwards, Marshall, much of his Cabinet and his advisors board Air Force One to return to the United States. Just before takeoff, they are joined by Marshall's family, First Lady Grace and First Daughter Alice. Meanwhile, six Radek loyalists, led by Egor Korshunov and posing as a Russian news crew, have boarded the plane and shortly after take-off are able to hijack the plane and kill several people with help from Gibbs, a mole in the Secret Service. Agents hustle a reluctant Marshall to the escape pod before Korshunov's men can capture him. In the cockpit, the pilots attempt to make an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. However, the hijackers breach the cockpit, shoot the pilots, and set course for Kazakhstan.\n\n::GENERAL::\n\nComplete name: Air Force One 1997 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 2181.77 MiB\nDuration: 2h 4mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 448 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2012-03-12 17:51:07\nSubtitles: English\nEncoded by Vice\n\n::VIDEO SPECIFICATION::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 120 r2164 da19765\nAverage video bitrate: 2000\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1\nResolution: 1280x532\nSource: Blu-ray Thanks\n\n::AUDIO SPECIFICATION::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nChannel positions Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/13171219292438880449.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/13171219292438880449.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/37915682566359371530.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/37915682566359371530.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/26608751193677821116.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/26608751193677821116.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/08971730974803531108.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/08971730974803531108.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n::Info Hash:: 15D94829F9DA2608F428151848D1E1217190FF49\n\n:::     :::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::\n:+:     :+:    :+:   :+:    :+::+:       \n+:+     +:+    +:+   +:+       +:+       \n+#+     +:+    +#+   +#+       +#++:++#  \n +#+   +#+     +#+   +#+       +#+       \n  #+#+#+#      #+#   #+#    #+##+#       \n    ###    ################### ##########","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d94829f9da2608f428151848d1e1217190ff49","amp;dn":"Air+Force+One+1997+720p+BRRip+x264+vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d94829f9da2608f428151848d1e1217190ff49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,217,72,41,249,218,38,8,244,40,21,24,72,209,225,33,113,144,255,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
