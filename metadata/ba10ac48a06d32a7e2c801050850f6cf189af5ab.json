The tale she spins---and the movie we watch---is a wild, surreal adventure in which people are able to project and enter each other's dreams, and our heroine is sold into slavery and lands in a swank, debauched Liverpool brothel where the patrons enact their literary/sexual fantasies with Lolita, St. Joan, and Desdemona. Rendered with dazzling tracking shots, striking CGI effects and a pulsing soundtrack, Hungarian director Szabolcs Hajdu's risk-taking fantasia has style to spare. But under the seductive surface lurks the very human story of a woman who uses fantasy to cushion the pain of life.\n\n\nLanguages: Romanian/Hungarian/German/Spanish/English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba10ac48a06d32a7e2c801050850f6cf189af5ab","amp;dn":"Bibliotheque+Pascal+2010+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba10ac48a06d32a7e2c801050850f6cf189af5ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,16,172,72,160,109,50,167,226,200,1,5,8,80,246,207,24,154,245,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
