A trio of young \nactors (Birkin, Chaplin, Bo) who specialize in &quot;appartment theatre&quot; are employed by\na rich and famous playwright (Kalfon) to stage his new work at a secluded mansion.\nCharacters with names like Virgil, Beatrice, Adriana and Bluebeard suggest that\nthis is going to be no ordinary performance. The roles and personalities of the\nactors mutate as the story unfolds, and  the castle reveals its true character.\n\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
