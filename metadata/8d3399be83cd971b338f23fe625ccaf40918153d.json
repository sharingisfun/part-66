The intruders kill his wife, and think they've killed both Mason and his son too. Mason is secretly taken to a hospital where he spends several years in a coma. His son meanwhile is growing up thinking his father is dead. When Mason wakes up, everyone is in danger - himself, his son, his best friend, his nurse - but most of all those who arranged for his death.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099739/plotsummary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099739/plotsummary&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d3399be83cd971b338f23fe625ccaf40918153d","amp;dn":"Hard+To+Kill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d3399be83cd971b338f23fe625ccaf40918153d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,51,153,190,131,205,151,27,51,143,35,254,98,92,202,244,9,24,21,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
