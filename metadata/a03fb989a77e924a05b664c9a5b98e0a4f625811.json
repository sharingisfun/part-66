This weekend, in an encore broadcast of the premiere episode of [i]Moyers &amp; Company[/i], Bill Moyers looks at AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic disparity and investigates how it happened and whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to blame. His detectives: political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, authors of [i]Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer Ã¢â‚¬â€ And Turned Its Back on the Middle Class[/i]. Through exhaustive research and analysis, Hacker and Pierson Ã¢â‚¬â€ whom Moyers regards as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sherlock Holmes and Dr. WatsonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of economics Ã¢â‚¬â€ detail important truths behind a 30-year economic assault against the middle class.\n\nMoyers calls the book Ã¢â‚¬Å“the best account IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen of how politicians rewrote the rules to create a winner-take-all economy that favors the 1% over everyone else, putting our once and future middle class in peril.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe show includes testimony of middle class Americans at a Senate hearing about the impact of hard times on families, as well as an essay on how Occupy Wall Street reflects a widespread belief that politics no longer works for ordinary people, including footage we took at the OWS rally from October-December 2011.\n\nEpisode webpage: [url]http://billmoyers.com/episode/encore-broadcast-on-winner-take-all-politics/[/url]\n\n-----\n\nType: mp4 file\nSize: 265MB\nRuntime: 00:52:46\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 640x360\nAudio: AAC 44100Hz stereo 108Kbps \n\nYou can also watch a flash video of this episode through your web-browser here:\n[url]http://billmoyers.com/episode/encore-broadcast-on-winner-take-all-politics/[/url]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a03fb989a77e924a05b664c9a5b98e0a4f625811","amp;dn":"Moyers+and+Company%2C+Mar+01+2012%3A+On+Winner-Take-All+Politics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a03fb989a77e924a05b664c9a5b98e0a4f625811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,63,185,137,167,126,146,74,5,182,100,201,165,185,142,10,79,98,88,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
