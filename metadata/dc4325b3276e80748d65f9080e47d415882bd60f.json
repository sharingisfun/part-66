Ignoring the warnings of more experienced aide workers, Sam breaks ground for an orphanage where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most needed-in the middle of territory controlled by the brutal LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Resistance Army (LRA), a renegade militia that forces youngsters to become soldiers before they even reach their teens. But for Sam, it is not enough to shelter the LRAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intended victims. Determined to save as many as possible, he leads armed missions deep into enemy territory to retrieve kidnapped children, restoring peace to their lives-and eventually his own.\n\n\nGenre: Action | Biography | Crime\nIMDB Rating: 6.6/10 from 2,457 users\nDirected by: Marc Forster\nStarring: Gerard Butler, Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon\n\nRelease Name: Machine.Gun.Preacher.2011.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO\nSize: 2 CD\nVideo: XviD, 624Ãƒâ€”256, 1582 kbit/s\nAudio: English, MP3, 128kbps\nRuntime: 104 min\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/jr3hW.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/jr3hW.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/IHPA.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/IHPA.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/0syc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/0syc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc4325b3276e80748d65f9080e47d415882bd60f","amp;dn":"Machine+Gun+Preacher+2011+DVDRip+XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc4325b3276e80748d65f9080e47d415882bd60f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,67,37,179,39,110,128,116,141,101,249,8,14,71,212,21,136,43,214,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
