Who better than bestselling author and Vanity Fair columnist Dominick Dunne to expose the sordid secrets of America's rich and famous? Already an established Hollywood producer in the late 70s, Dunne left the world of Los Angeles to live a simpler kind of life and work on his writing. A personal tragedy soon gave Dunne a clear purpose: to draw attention to those members of high society who believe their wealth and privilege exempt them from legal repercussions. Eager to hold these parties accountable for their mistakes, Dunne has dedicated his time to exploring the seedy underbelly of fame and celebrity ever since.\n\n\nEpisode 6 : Waitress and the Millionaire - The Beard Murder Scandal\n\nA wealthy 70-year old TV executive Steven Beard is murdered, and his 32-year-old wife, former Country Club Waitress Celeste Beard is arrested two years later, accused with her female lover of conspiracy.
