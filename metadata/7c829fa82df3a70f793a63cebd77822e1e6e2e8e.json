Some work, others don't. That's why instead of recording the entire 3 hours only to find at the end that the disc was suddenly &quot;unreadable&quot;, I recorded the first hour and stopped it as a test. When it properly saved I did the other two hours, and that also saved. Then I finalized the disc so my computer's optical drive can read it. So this show is complete, but in two files.\n\nSince Hal Sparks hasn't been on the show for a few weeks now, &quot;Humpdays with Hal&quot; has left a void on Wednesday, so now Stephanie's in-studio guest for what she calls &quot;Coffee with Carlos&quot; is comedian Carlos Alazraqui, famous from Reno 911.\n\nTwo of the guests on the phone are Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and weekly regular commentator David Bender.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c829fa82df3a70f793a63cebd77822e1e6e2e8e","amp;dn":"STEPHANIE+MILLER+--+5-9-2012+%28+in+two+files+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c829fa82df3a70f793a63cebd77822e1e6e2e8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,130,159,168,45,243,167,15,121,58,99,206,189,119,130,46,30,110,46,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
