All through the film you try to guess what he is thinking. He was adopted by the mother of Esqueda (Anthony Quinn) and Quinn loves and respects him. The real surprise is Howard Keel, who only used to do musicals, coming out so well as King Cameron, a man who is obstinate about building a cattle empire. Cameron is married to Cordelia (Ava Gardner) and as soon as she arrives in a river boat, and they go to their ranch, trouble starts because it has been burnt by Esqueda. Why did Esqueda do it? Because he knows that if he allows anybody to do well in business in that area, others will come and eventually he, who is a bandit will have to run away or be hanged. Quinn is great as Esqueda, just that makes the film worth seeing. Taylor, who was the second man to Quinn in the gang, eventually leaves him to help Keel, because deep down he knows his brother is becoming a crazy monster and unconsciously he is in love with Ava. Excellent film, not to be missed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccd73ddd8dc598e69d31d8a5770deee861ea825e","amp;dn":"Ride%2C+Vaquero%21+%281953%29+84+min.Robert+Taylor%2CAnthony+Quinn%2CAva+Gar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccd73ddd8dc598e69d31d8a5770deee861ea825e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,215,61,221,141,197,152,230,157,49,216,165,119,13,238,232,97,234,130,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
