The lander carries two astronauts; one of them a black male model (James Washington, played by Christopher Kirby) specifically chosen to aid the current President of the United States (played by Stephanie Paul) in her re-election. Upon landing on the Moon, the two encounter Nazis which have been on the Moon since 1945, and Washington is taken captive.\n \nThe Nazi scientist Doktor Richter (played by Tilo PrÃƒÂ¼ckner) is called in to investigate Washington and finds his smartphone. Although initially skeptical, he recognizes that the computing power of this device far outmatches anything they have come up with themselves and integrates the device into the GÃƒÂ¶tterdÃƒÂ¤mmerung, the primary Nazi spaceship. Unfortunately for Richter, the phone stops working due to an empty battery just as he is demonstrating its power to his superiors, especially the new FÃƒÂ¼hrer Wolfgang Kortzfleisch (played by Udo Kier). Nazi Klaus Adler (played by GÃƒÂ¶tz Otto), who is (for genetic reasons) destined to marry Earth specialist Renate Richter (daughter of Doktor Richter; played by Julia Dietze) offers to go to Earth to find another device with the same computing power. Adler takes a spacecraft to Earth, taking Renate and James with him, the latter having been aryanized (i.e., his skin turned to white) by Richter.\n \nMeanwhile on Earth, the President of the United States is having some problems of her own; she desperately needs a miracle to ensure her re-election. Her aide, Vivian Wagner (played by Peta Sergeant) presents her with the two Nazis. Adler and Richter go on to transform the Presidents' campaign Nazi-style, with apparent success, although Richter is unaware of the plans of Adler to both annihilate the United States and of overthrowing the current FÃƒÂ¼hrer.\n \nAfter three months, Kortzfleisch seems to have figured out Adler's plan. He sends his armada (though without the GÃƒÂ¶tterdÃƒÂ¤mmerung) to Earth orbit. He himself lands on Earth, confronting Adler; at the same time, Renate Richter finds Washington, now a homeless person, in the streets and recognizes Adler's true intent as well. Adler kills Kortzfleisch and takes his position, returning to orbit with Kortzfleisch's flying saucer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b6c0d35141db7efe657b822834729861a8de066","amp;dn":"IRON+SKY+XVID+CAM+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b6c0d35141db7efe657b822834729861a8de066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,108,13,53,20,29,183,239,230,87,184,34,131,71,41,134,26,141,224,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
