Many times along the way in my music career, The Pirate Bay has helped me in my time of need. Now it is my turn to share my work with others. If you wish to follow my band more closely or *gasp* buy something directly from me, you may do so at http://www.deliberatelies.com\n\nI also enjoy emails! &lt;3\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f082919795b094959c999295829184959c999583de939f9d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n\nBut mainly, enjoy the music and share it with your friends. :)\n\n\n--\n\nTracks included:\n01 Pearls\n02 Dotkom\n03 Trendy\n04 Out of Touch\n05 Blood Blood Blood\n06 Rough Me Up\n07 Fuck With My Head\n\nAll tracks in 160 kpbs MP3 format\n\n--\n\nThis is the official debut album from Deliberate Lies, representing the tail end of 5 years spent in self-imposed exile. Departing somewhat from piano-dominated riffs in earlier works, DLS features thick synth-guitar textures, heavy beats, flowing orchestration, and Rage's signature mixed vocal style.\n\nGuest contributions include Jamie on guitar (Trendy), Caere on backing vocals (Blood Blood Blood), and Jon Hillyard on artwork and logo design.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a35b04160f2c27b0709ed3e1c44bea935e01970","amp;dn":"Deliberate+lies+-+DLS+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a35b04160f2c27b0709ed3e1c44bea935e01970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,53,176,65,96,242,194,123,7,9,237,62,28,68,190,169,53,224,25,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
