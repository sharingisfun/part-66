Besides screen management, it includes hardware-accelerated eyefinity and has extensive hot-key support.\n\nHydraVision was originally developed in late 90s by Appian Graphics[15] for their multi-head display solutions. ATI acquired HydraVision in July 2001 along with Appian's HydraVision team to join its then-new dual-head Radeon 7500 and 8500 series.\n\nCurrently it is an optional component of the Catalyst software suite.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_HydraVision#HydraVision&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_HydraVision#HydraVision&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwww.amd.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87bd5eb182d1c63a5c17e7b584c3433ac99455bd","amp;dn":"HydraVision+Package+V12-2+x32-x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87bd5eb182d1c63a5c17e7b584c3433ac99455bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,189,94,177,130,209,198,58,92,23,231,181,132,195,67,58,201,148,85,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
