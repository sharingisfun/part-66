Just carry it in a flash drive and use on any computer, even without administrator access. No settings on the host computer are changed. The portable app creates a sandbox folder in its current location, where it stores all its settings and temporary files. Make as many copies of the app as you need. No more conflicts with other applications. No more 'hijacking' of file types.\n\nThe app creates a Sandbox folder in its current location. So the location of the app should have read-write access. (You cannot use the portable app when its location is read-only - eg. A CD/ DVD drive or a read-only network location.) If you have any problem using the app, just delete the contents of the sandbox folder and start over again (Don't delete the 'Sandbox' folder itself).\n\nIf you want to download other apps created by the author, visit:\nSelect List:\nFull List:\nUse 7-zip to extract the downloaded archives.\n\nPlatform : Window Xp\nI haven't tried on window 7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:981dc936d53747bf4c474cf04c036eb267620a67","amp;dn":"Portable+E-Kundali+v6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"981dc936d53747bf4c474cf04c036eb267620a67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,29,201,54,213,55,71,191,76,71,76,240,76,3,110,178,103,98,10,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
