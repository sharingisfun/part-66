The campaign is a good 12 hours long at the normal difficulty setting, and the dynamic nature of the battles, along with the multiple, well-balanced difficulty settings, gives it good replay value. The multiplayer component only supports up to 16 players and includes a bare-bones integrated server finder. The game tends to play smoothly online if you can find a server with a low enough ping, and it features an assortment of different modes, which are variations on the standard modes of play found in your typical multiplayer shooter: They include slayer (meaning, deathmatch), team slayer, capture the flag, king of the hill, and some others\n\n\nHALO 2\n\n\nDEscriptION\n\nThe epic saga continues with &quot;Halo 2,&quot; the much anticipated sequel to the highly successful and critically acclaimed game &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved.&quot; In this sequel, the battle comes to Earth, and Master Chief, a genetically enhanced super soldier, is the only thing standing between the relentless alien Covenant and the destruction of all humankind. Pushing the Xbox hardware to its very limits, &quot;Halo 2&quot; will expand on everything that made the original game great, plus add a wealth of technological and gameplay advances.\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\n1.
