With many fearing      \n    a nuclear retaliation from Israel, their mission was to find and       \n    destroy the source of the missiles being fired. But the operation      \n       went spectacularly wrong. The SAS force was discovered and          \n   attacked. Some of the men were killed while others tried to escape      \n        by walking 200 miles across the Iraqi desert. Essentially          \n    abandoned, the men were left to fend for themselves, deep inside       \n      Iraq. For the first time, retired USAF General Charles Horner        \n      reveals why the men of the Bravo Two Zero Patrol were sent on        \n     their perilous mission and surviving members of the team, Cpl.        \n     Chris Ryan and Sgt. Andy McNab, recall their harrowing ordeal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96303def20677ba1424e2b1e38314f5eadddff1f","amp;dn":"SAS.Behind.Iraqi.Lines.2007.iNTERNAL.DVDRip.XviD-aRMED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96303def20677ba1424e2b1e38314f5eadddff1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,48,61,239,32,103,123,161,66,78,43,30,56,49,79,94,173,221,255,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
