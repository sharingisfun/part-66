This game combines elements from every Mario game ever made into one, and the result is a lot of fun. While the level design is far from perfect you shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss out on this free download for Windows.\n\nWhether you know it or not, you want to play new 2D Mario levels. Nintendo takes its dear sweet time putting such levels out, so if you need something to hold you over until the inevitable release of New Super Mario Brothers Wii 2, I highly recommend you check out this unofficial fan-built game. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free, so you have nothing to lose by trying it out. You might even find things here you like better than NintendoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own projects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59e4894378339e9c2a297e0ffff4078e170c603d","amp;dn":"Super+Mario+Bros+X+-+Magik_420.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59e4894378339e9c2a297e0ffff4078e170c603d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,228,137,67,120,51,158,156,42,41,126,15,255,244,7,142,23,12,96,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
