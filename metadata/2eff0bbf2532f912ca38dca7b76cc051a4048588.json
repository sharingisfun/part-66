This cut has much of the child pandering merchandise making content removed from it. Much of this film is a faithfully matched cut-for-cut of the original Phantom Cut with the exception of the reincorporation of a deleted scene, the removal and replacement of the GOD AWFUL Yoda puppet with a CGI one, slightly altered subtitles, a more condensed version of the Gungan battle against the droids, and even less Jar Jar antics than the original Phantom Cut.\n\nThis movie is in a DVD folder format and can be placed on a Dual Layer blank DVD via the shareware program ImgBurn, or played with a media player such as VLC, or Cyberlink PowerDVD.\n\nThis movie was edited on a 64 bit Windows 7 machine with 4GBs of RAM, an Intel i7 processor, Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5, and Roxio Creator 2010 Pro. I wish to thank the Phantom Editor and George Lucas (Yes, even him) for helping hobby editors to give their own creative spin on a project.\n\nSincerely, RemasteredJedi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eff0bbf2532f912ca38dca7b76cc051a4048588","amp;dn":"Phantom+Cut+Remastered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eff0bbf2532f912ca38dca7b76cc051a4048588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,255,11,191,37,50,249,18,202,56,220,167,183,108,192,81,164,4,133,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
