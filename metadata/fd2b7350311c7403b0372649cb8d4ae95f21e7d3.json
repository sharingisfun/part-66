She has never met her father, who left Sarah before Elizabeth was born. Sarah is now married to Tim, a recovering alcoholic who used to physically abuse Sarah when he was drunk.\n\nOne night Elizabeth goes out to a bar and meets Johnny, a shy, kind-hearted twenty-three-year-old. Elizabeth and Johnny begin dating and quickly grow very close, although she is hesitant to admit how much she needs him. Johnny, however, knows that he's deeply in love with her. After a couple months of seeing each other, they have a falling out. One night soon after, Johnny is involved in a car accident. The doctors determine that he doesn't have long to live.\n\nSeth, a guarded man who appears to be twenty-five, has been watching over Elizabeth. Seth takes it upon himself to save Johnny in the only way that he can: He turns Johnny into a vampire.\n\nStruggling to come to terms with their past, present, and each other, Elizabeth, Johnny, and Seth must do nothing less than discover who they truly are and what they're really capable of.\n\nDaylight Fades is a film that explores loss, regret, love, redemption, mortality, and the bonds that can keep us together or pull us apart. It's a story about people who are desperate for a second chance, realizing it may be their last.  \n       \n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/14143488955348589654.gif[/img]\n\nFormat            : AVI at 1 014 Kbps\nLength            : 698 MiB for 1h 36mn 15s 640ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 556 Kbps\nAspect            : 688 x 288 (2.389) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\n\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : \nGenre Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  : Drama    \nEncoder           : fasamoo\nSource            : PAL DVD5\nSample            : Yes\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1368860/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1368860/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/24140653840445067068.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/24140653840445067068.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/50756841505268298452.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/50756841505268298452.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/49746196622453803098.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/49746196622453803098.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/17645122094049967518.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/17645122094049967518.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/48296333546271811408.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/48296333546271811408.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/48599539503322408220.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/48599539503322408220.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/49630312745735842728.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/49630312745735842728.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/34168402316479426301.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/34168402316479426301.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/70229700021636880581.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/70229700021636880581.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/91327889333077221699.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/91327889333077221699.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/10569153800019538820.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/10569153800019538820.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGreetz to all P2P RGs.\n\nSpecial Thanks To: SaM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2b7350311c7403b0372649cb8d4ae95f21e7d3","amp;dn":"Daylight+Fades+%282010%29+DVDRip+Xvid+AC3-Anarchy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2b7350311c7403b0372649cb8d4ae95f21e7d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,43,115,80,49,28,116,3,176,55,38,73,203,141,74,233,95,33,231,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
