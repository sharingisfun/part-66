The series follows key members of the London Underground's 19,000-strong staff, from CEO Howard Collins through to the litter pickers who clear miles of track every night. Drivers, station staff and emergency response workers reveal their unique perspective on the travelling public. Capturing the tube in all its guises, from tourist transport to suburban commute, or the last train home for partygoers, this series also looks behind the scenes of the tube's ten billion pound upgrade - and how the process of dragging a Victorian infrastructure kicking and screaming into the 21st century doesn't always run on rails.\n\n\n\n3)  One Under \nFor Tube drivers, their worst fear is somebody jumping or falling in front of their train. We follow what happens when this fear becomes a distressing reality for two drivers. Also, we meet the crews of the Tube's specialised emergency response units as they are scrambled to deal with any eventuality on the Underground, from accidents and injuries to mysterious obstructions on the line. Plus how the Tube - and its dedicated British Transport Police officers - copes with the demands of the Notting Hill Carnival\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/5512/thetubescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/5512/thetubescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/4428/thetubescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/4428/thetubescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img515/356/thetubescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img515/356/thetubescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/8860/thetubescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/8860/thetubescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img192/9601/thetubescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img192/9601/thetubescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img221/1166/thetubescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img221/1166/thetubescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/729/thetubescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/729/thetubescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img840/7403/thetubescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img840/7403/thetubescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/5968/thetubescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/5968/thetubescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img10/7405/thetubescreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img10/7405/thetubescreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img214/2452/thetubescreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img214/2452/thetubescreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img207/5940/thetubescreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img207/5940/thetubescreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1534 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:702 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.studentjournals.co.uk/culture/television/806-the-tube-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.studentjournals.co.uk/culture/television/806-the-tube-review&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:410cb3a432088c78c175a1d8b667b4e0a994761d","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Tube+3of6+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"410cb3a432088c78c175a1d8b667b4e0a994761d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,12,179,164,50,8,140,120,193,117,161,216,182,103,180,224,169,148,118,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
