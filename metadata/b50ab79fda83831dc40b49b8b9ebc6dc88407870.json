Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50ab79fda83831dc40b49b8b9ebc6dc88407870","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+10+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50ab79fda83831dc40b49b8b9ebc6dc88407870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,10,183,159,218,131,131,29,196,11,73,184,185,235,198,220,136,64,120,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
