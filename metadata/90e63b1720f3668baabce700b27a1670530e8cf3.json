Our prayers, this time, are surrounding this page rather than LukeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass drum. Memories dance in the forefront of our minds as glances swiftly shift from face to face; memories of the storms that raged and waters that rose which, together, fabricated this new EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Ship Built to Sink.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The introductory track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dreams that Breathe,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ will heave a listener into a dreamlike state of mind and onto the icy timber deck of our ship in the midst of our darkest hours. The five of us have fought together as brothers through the storms and wove our tales like a finely made reed basket. Each song, both instrumentally and lyrically, tells all of our stories in harmonic unison; accounts of demon oppression, lust, lost hope and broken faiths, psychological disarray, rejection, and, above all, redemption and salvation.\n\nWe human beings are but sailors on ships (ships representing our lives) stuck on a downward course straight for the mouth of the Maelstrom. It is not, however, a hopeless journey. If we allow God to captain our vessel this disaster can be wholly avoided. All we have to do is ask.\n\nMy Heart To Fear:\nInvictus Ep\nA Ship Built To Sink Ep\nInto The Maelstrom Full Album\nBonus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90e63b1720f3668baabce700b27a1670530e8cf3","amp;dn":"My+Heart+To+Fear+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90e63b1720f3668baabce700b27a1670530e8cf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,230,59,23,32,243,102,139,170,188,231,0,178,122,22,112,83,14,140,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
