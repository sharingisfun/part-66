Being transported to some weird dimension full of goblins, dwarves, swamplings, stupid wizards and sleeping giants is definitely one of them. \nSimon is a teenager transported into a fantasy world as a sorcerer dressed in a cloak and pointy hat. He must use his logic and magical skills to solve puzzles as he progresses through the game.\n\nThe story begins with the protagonist, Simon, as an ordinary teenager. His dog, &quot;Chippy&quot;, discovers a chest in the loft of his house containing a spellbook titled &quot;Ye Olde Spellbooke&quot;. Simon throws the book onto the floor in contempt, but a portal opens above it. Chippy goes through the portal and Simon follows.\nAfter entering the portal, Simon finds himself in another world. He escapes from some goblins who intended to eat him and discovers that he has been brought on a quest to rescue the wizard Calypso from the evil sorcerer Sordid.\n\nWhen Simon discovers the tuneless bard, the repulsive Rapunzel and a pair of demons with a serious attitude problem, it could prove to be one clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© too far. \nWith a Nobel Prize for attempted humour and puzzles so fiendish you'll certainly need help from the wise owl, Simon the Sorcerer is guaranteed to provide a distraction from the drudgery of modern life. \n\n&quot;Gorgeously drawn, superbly animated&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ PC REVIEW\n\n&quot;Leaves you dazzled, hoarse and tired, but in the end it's all worth it&quot; - PC POWER\n\n&quot;An Answer to the American Adventure&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ PC ZONE\n\n\nCopyright owned by Adventure Soft Publishing. \nSimon the Sorcerer is a registered trademark of Adventure Soft Publishing.\n\niPhoneOS Port and Distribution by iPhSoft.\nFor more information please visit:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://iPhSoft.com/Simon1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://iPhSoft.com/Simon1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMusic Enhancement by James Woodcock: www.jameswoodcock.co.uk\n\nUses ScummVM which is protected under GNU-GPL v2.\nScummVM Copyright (c) 2001-20 09.
