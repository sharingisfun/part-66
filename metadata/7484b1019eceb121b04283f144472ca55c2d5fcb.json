A penniless ex-con dies a gristly death in a house he can ill afford. The detectives assigned the case are Min, newly reinstated after a suspension, and Lee, a new transfer from forensics. Min has nightmares: a sexual assault that haunts her. She and Lee work well together, but soon two more deaths occur - each mysteriously poisoned, both friends of the ex-con. A fourth friend, a newly married doctor, is a suspect. But what has all this to do with the salt storehouse, a death ten years ago, and a missing girl? Can Min and Lee get to the bottom of it, or is the supernatural beyond a cop's reach?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7484b1019eceb121b04283f144472ca55c2d5fcb","amp;dn":"ARANG+Tartan+Asian+Extreme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7484b1019eceb121b04283f144472ca55c2d5fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,132,177,1,158,206,177,33,176,66,131,241,68,71,44,165,92,45,95,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
