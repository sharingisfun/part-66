This grim l6th Century castle is Colditz, the most notorious prisoner of war camp in history. With its imposing walls and rigorous policing, Colditz was seen as the ultimate prison.\n\nThe Germans believed escape from Colditz was aIl but impossible. However, over five extraordinary years, they were proved wrong time and again, defeated by achievements of boundless bravery, planning and ingenuity.\n\nUsing archive material, dramatic reconstruction, and the personal testimony of Colditz veterans, this intriguing three part series from Channel 4 Television documents the creative and often spectacular attempt to go over, under or through the walls.\n\nFor the first time the Allied Officers of three nations return to Colditz to reopen the tunnels and retrace the routes of their legendary escapes.\nWith as many guards as prisoners, Colditz was considered escape-proof. But it wasn't long before the officers pooled their talents to create the greatest escape academy of the war. Often for the first time, the English, French, Dutch and Polish officers and their guards describe their experiences.\n\nTwelve years in the making, the film uses over 50 original interviews to capture the true stories behind the castle's infamous walls.\n\nA Production by Windfall Films for Channel 4\nChannel Four Television Corporation MM\nRunnlng Time: 150 mine approx\n\n\n\nEpisode 2 : The Best of British\n\nThis episode looks at a period of great success for the British escapers, and examines the ingenuity and expertise that were so important in securing escapes.
