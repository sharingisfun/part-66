The film stars Brian Keith (who had worked with Peckinpah on The Westerner television series) as &quot;Yellowleg&quot;, a gunman who escorts a dancehall girl (O'Hara) across the desert in order to bury her recently deceased son alongside the boy's father. Their journey is complicated by unfriendly Indians as well as Yellowleg's treacherous partners (played by Chill Wills and Steve Cochran). This movie has an excellent cast, beautiful scenery and a good story.
