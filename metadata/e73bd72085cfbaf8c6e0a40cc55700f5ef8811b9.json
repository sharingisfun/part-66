The subsequent loss of public confidence in psychotherapy was devastating to psychiatrist Paul R. McHugh, and with Try to Remember, he looks at what went wrong and describes what must be done to restore psychotherapy to a more honored and useful place in therapeutic treatment.\n\nIn this thought-provoking account, McHugh explains why trendy diagnoses and misguided treatments have repeatedly taken over psychotherapy. He recounts his participation in court battles that erupted over diagnoses of recovered memories and the frequent companion diagnoses of multiple-personality disorders. He also warns that diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder today may be perpetuating a similar misdirection, thus exacerbating the patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ suffering. He argues that both the public and psychiatric professionals must raise their standards for psychotherapy, in order to ensure that the incorrect designation of memory as the root cause of disorders does not occur again. Psychotherapy, McHugh ultimately shows, is a valuable healing methodÃ¢â‚¬â€and at the very least an important adjunct treatmentÃ¢â‚¬â€to the numerous psychopharmaceuticals that flood the drug market today.\n\nAn urgent call to arms for patients and therapists alike, Try to Remember delineates the difference between good and bad psychiatry and challenges us to reconsider psychotherapy as the most effective way to heal troubled minds.\n \n\n\nHardcover: 300 pages\nPublisher: Dana Press; 1 edition (November 15, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1932594396\nISBN-13: 978-1932594393","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73bd72085cfbaf8c6e0a40cc55700f5ef8811b9","amp;dn":"Try+to+Remember+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73bd72085cfbaf8c6e0a40cc55700f5ef8811b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,59,215,32,133,207,186,248,198,224,164,12,197,87,0,245,239,136,17,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
