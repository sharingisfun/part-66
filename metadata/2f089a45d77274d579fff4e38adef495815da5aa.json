THIS WEEK?S SNAPSHOT IS EXTRA EXPERIMENTAL!\n \nThis week we?ve started working on separating the server logic from the client. The \n\npurpose of this is both to make it easier for us to add features (since we don?t have \n\nto implement stuff Ã¢â‚¬Å“twiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and also to make it possible for you to invite people to \n\nplay on your local computer without setting up a server. In other words, more like \n\nhow it works on Minecraft: Pocket Edition.\n\nThe work has not been completed yet, though, but a snapshot?s a snapshot. However, the game should still run fine, and we?ve also made some other tweaks:\n\n\n1. More fixes to silk touch and block picking\n2. Wooden tools work in furnaces\n3. Villagers spawned from spawning eggs will get a random profession\n4. Updated language files\n5. EtcÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSTALL INTRUCTIONS \n\n\nWindows- \n\n1. Type %appdata% in the search bar \n\n2. .minecraft/bin\n\n3. change your current .jar file to whatever you like ( Example: minecraft1.1.jar )\n\n4. now just change the current .jar file that you downloaded to minecraft.jar\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMAC - \n\n1. goto Finder/User/Library/Application Support/minecraft \n\n2. FOLLOW STEPS 2-4 above.\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f089a45d77274d579fff4e38adef495815da5aa","amp;dn":"Minecraft+1.3.4+%5B+PreRelease+4+%5D+12w18a+-+JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f089a45d77274d579fff4e38adef495815da5aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,8,154,69,215,114,116,213,121,255,244,227,138,222,244,149,129,93,165,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
