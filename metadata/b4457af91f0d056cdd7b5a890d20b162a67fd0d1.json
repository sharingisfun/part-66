It is a curious case in which Bilal can see but his parents are sightless. He follows Bilal hometo a slum in Kolkata and over the next one year he films Bilal and his little brother Hamza in his surroundings. In that dark tiny room, surrounded by his friends and relatives, Bilal and his parents share a poverty ridden existence. It is not easy for the parents - but they try. And a curious bright Bilal plays hide and seek by going out into the light. In his exuberance he breaks his arm and gets ito other dangers. It is a story of love, fun, cruelty and hope. ...\n\nThe wonder world of Bilal.\n\nComments:\nThere are few films that have moved me as much as this documentary. As bilal moves about, unaware of the camera and we watch him adjust to his parents blindness, we start sharing his life with him and start wondering how his parents will manage this frolicsome little boy. Yet this is not just the story of Bilal. It is also the story of grinding poverty and the disadvantages that two handicapped people face in their fight for survival. It is a story of resilience too, for Bilal's parents, facing odds that any of us would wither under, still struggle on, still retain a semblance of dignity and still try to do their best for Bilal and Hamza. You would have to be extremely hard hearted if you don't want to reach out to them...\n\nNot for nothing did this film sweep awards worldwide...\n\nAlthough the movie is in Bengali, English Subtitles have been provided. Much of the film does not require subtitles, the images are so graphic in themselves.\n\nScreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/9c3bee181812935&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/9c3bee181812935&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/d76d2d181812989&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/d76d2d181812989&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/d4affe181813074&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/d4affe181813074&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4457af91f0d056cdd7b5a890d20b162a67fd0d1","amp;dn":"Bilal-x264.aac.700-DDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4457af91f0d056cdd7b5a890d20b162a67fd0d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,69,122,249,31,13,5,108,221,123,90,137,13,32,177,98,166,127,208,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
