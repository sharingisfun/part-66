Second Half.\n\n\nDespite the 1-3 result in the away leg, Pep Guardiola doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe the tie against Bayer 04 Leverkusen is over. The FC Barcelona manager reminded the packed press room of how difficult it was against Real Madrid in the return leg of the KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cup, despite winning 1-2 at the BernabÃƒÂ©u. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trap is that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve earned a better result than last year,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said. Guardiola said that Ã¢â‚¬Å“we must play a good game; we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go out to defend, we have to try to win and qualify for the quarter-finals.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAware of the Leverkusen's pace \n\nThe BarÃƒÂ§a manager is very aware of the dangers that Bayer 04 bring to pitch. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Their pace, their areal play, dead balls, that's what makes them dangerous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gaurdiola talked about Bayer 04Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s game plan in the second half at the BayArena to highlight what his team should expect tomorrow: Ã¢â‚¬Å“when we let them run like in the second half [of the away leg], theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re stronger. We have to try to slow them down a bit and command the game in our side of the pitch.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Guardiola is wary of the team led by Robin Dutt, who said that his team has nothing to lose and everything to win in tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s showdown: Ã¢â‚¬Å“like any good German side, they never give up on anything. It appears as though theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re out of the match but suddenly they create goal scoring chances.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nA break from La Liga \n\nGuardiola has the chance to take his team to the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the fourth year in a row. The manager recognised that the continental competition is good for his team: Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a beautiful competition that allows us to make a clean break from La Liga. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll try to stay in the competition by playing a good game.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHe agrees with the ClubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stance \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I completely agree with Toni Freixas,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Guardiola when asked about the spokesmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s press conference. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t saying whether we agree or not on if PiquÃƒÂ© should be punished, we want to know what the rules are. It appears as though the Board never does anything right, but we just want to know what criteria is used by the Committee to ban players.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOn Gerard PiquÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s statements after he was ejected from this weekendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s match, Guardiola believes that every player should be held responsible for what they do. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you limit them in the press room, you limit them on the pitch.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nResolution: 1920 x 1080\nAudio: Stereo.
