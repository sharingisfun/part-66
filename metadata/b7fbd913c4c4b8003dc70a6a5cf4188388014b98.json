No matter the genre or theme, he excels with power beyond contemporary standards. For the most part, American singers just lack that special, natural quality that Chou has, even with their studios thatÃ¯Â»Â¿ perfect their voice and synthesize bad vibrato. I wish Asian culture was more recognized in the States, our radio stations could use some actual music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7fbd913c4c4b8003dc70a6a5cf4188388014b98","amp;dn":"Jay+Chou+-+General+%28%E5%B0%87%E8%BB%8D%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7fbd913c4c4b8003dc70a6a5cf4188388014b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,251,217,19,196,196,184,0,61,199,10,106,92,244,24,131,136,1,75,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
