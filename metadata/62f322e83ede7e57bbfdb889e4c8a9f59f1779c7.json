The apathetic and hostile rural congregation rejects him immediately. Through his diary entries, the suffering young man relays a crisis of faith that threatens to drive him away from the village and from God. With his fourth film, Robert Bresson began to implement his stylistic philosophy as a filmmaker, stripping away all inessential elements from his compositions, the dialogue and the music, exacting a purity of image and sound.\n\n*** THE BEST WAY TO MESSAGE ME IS TO COMMENT ON MY LATEST UPLOAD, I AM GETTING TOO MANY UP THERE TO MONITOR ALL OF THEM. ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f322e83ede7e57bbfdb889e4c8a9f59f1779c7","amp;dn":"Diary+of+a+Country+Priest+%281951%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f322e83ede7e57bbfdb889e4c8a9f59f1779c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,243,34,232,62,222,126,87,187,253,184,137,228,200,169,245,159,23,121,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
