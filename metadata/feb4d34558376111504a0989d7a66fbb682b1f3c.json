Haunted by the fantasy, or the memory, of a beautiful Parisian woman called Jaya, he plans to write a book around his voyage. On the banks of the turquoise Ganges, one morning, he chances upon Zehra, an irresistible poetess-dancing girl in the tradition of the great courtesans, who performs in a nearby brothel. Zehra resurrects the memory of Jaya. As love casts its spell once again on Nishant, he asks Zehra to join him on his journey, but her illusory freedom is shadowed by a formidable network of the brothel's spies. Nonetheless, Nishant manages to make Zehra flee from the brothel, and join him on his journey. Romance takes over. A new life begins for Zehra as Nishant would like her to accompany him back to Paris. Half way down the river, at the height of their romance, Nishant receives a telegram. Zehra soon realises how Nishant's fantasy of a half-real half-unreal woman could transform her life into a journey of ambiguous surprises...\n\nCast :\nAsil Rais - Nishant\nSmriti Mishra - Zehra\nPaula Klein - Jaya\nVijay Singh- Sanjay\nAnupam Shyam - Bulldog\n\nMedia Info:\n\nLanguage - Hindi (Indian)\nVideo Size - 493 MB\nVideo Codec - H.264/AVC\nVideo Res - 720 x 464\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.97 fps \nVideo Bitrate - 862 Kbps\nVideo Container - Matroska Video\nSubtitles - English Hardcoded\nAudio Codec - AAC\nChannels - Stereo\nSample Rate - 48000 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 1 Hr 19 mins\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haOopAADa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haOopAADa&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb4d34558376111504a0989d7a66fbb682b1f3c","amp;dn":"Jaya+Ganga+%7E+1998+%7E+Hindi+%7E+493+MB+%7E+E-subs+%7E+Phantom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feb4d34558376111504a0989d7a66fbb682b1f3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,180,211,69,88,55,97,17,80,74,9,137,215,166,111,187,104,43,31,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
