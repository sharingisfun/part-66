Suppose you saw a friend's spouse cheating -- would you tell her? What if you saw a young girl being cruelly taunted by other girls - would you confront them? Using hidden cameras, ''Primetime: What Would You Do?'' sets up everyday scenarios and then captures people's reactions. Whether they're compelled to act or mind their own business, John Quinones reports on their split-second - and often surprising - decision-making process.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d720b7e15813e83d35fc1977b8cb80f865de2494","amp;dn":"what.would.you.do.2012-03-23.haircut.from.hell-youre.marrying.he","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d720b7e15813e83d35fc1977b8cb80f865de2494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,32,183,225,88,19,232,61,53,252,25,119,184,203,128,248,101,222,36,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
