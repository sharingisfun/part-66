LauraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works have spawned dozens of franchises and cult horror movie classics.  A yearly film festival offers a large cash prize that would be enough to clear her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name.  With the help of her roommate, Jenny, a college washout, and  Cam,  their underage boss from the Coffee Hut, these ordinary people set out on an extraordinary journey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a journey that will show them much more than the sinister truth of LauraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d18d5133fe490de87d0b2827206f27d3e5b7d2b","amp;dn":"The+Directors+Project+DVD+Rip+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d18d5133fe490de87d0b2827206f27d3e5b7d2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,24,213,19,63,228,144,222,135,208,178,130,114,6,242,125,62,91,125,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
