I searched the web and found nothing.  Luckily searching my hard drives I found the drivers.  So here they are.  This should be everything you need for a Viliv S5 Windows 7 or Windows 8 install.  This is for the non 3g version, but I did also include an updated version of the Viliv Manager which may work with the 3g version.\n\nYou must install the Viliv system file and the Atom_Io_Control driver first before any other drivers.  The atom driver must be installed as a legacy driver in device manager.  Touch screen should replace ps2 driver in Device manager.\n\nSee here for more info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.pocketables.net/showthread.php?t=2451&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.pocketables.net/showthread.php?t=2451&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:355ae8940ca1d55500a04ffc19bcb2b8e2faff86","amp;dn":"Viliv+S5+Windows+7+Drivers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"355ae8940ca1d55500a04ffc19bcb2b8e2faff86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,90,232,148,12,161,213,85,0,160,79,252,25,188,178,184,226,250,255,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
