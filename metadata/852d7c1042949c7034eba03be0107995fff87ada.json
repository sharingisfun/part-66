You control a small robot equipped with an anti-gravity device, a jet-pack and a gun. Drive, jump, fly, swim and shoot your way through 24 levels scattered across 6 unique environments.\n\nUse BEEPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anti-gravity device to directly manipulate the physics-based environments. The anti-gravity device is both a tool and a weapon. Use it to smash enemy robots, build towers and solve puzzles.\n\nBEEP has traveled for thousands of years through deep space to explore the Galaxy. Traverse a foreign star system with the BEEP-ship and send robots to the surface of the planets.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bigfatalien.com/BEEP/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bigfatalien.com/BEEP/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852d7c1042949c7034eba03be0107995fff87ada","amp;dn":"BEEP+RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852d7c1042949c7034eba03be0107995fff87ada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,45,124,16,66,148,156,112,52,235,160,59,224,16,121,149,255,248,122,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
