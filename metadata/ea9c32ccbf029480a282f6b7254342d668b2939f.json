It is mainly about riots, car chases, crime, accidents and much much more from around the world. Despite its title with the word &quot;Banned&quot; in, it has been shown on reality tv as well as many European/Asian TV news channels when most of the things happened. It is banned in the United Kingdom by the BBFC because they argue that the footage was presented as entertainment. &quot;There is no attempt to justify the images by placing the incidents in any other journalistic or educational context. Whatever current relevance the images might have had when they were originally photographed has been lost in the general compilation of horrors&quot;.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 520x376 - 29.97fps - 57mn 54s 371ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea9c32ccbf029480a282f6b7254342d668b2939f","amp;dn":"Banned+from+Television+%5B1998%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea9c32ccbf029480a282f6b7254342d668b2939f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,156,50,204,191,2,148,128,162,130,246,183,37,67,66,214,104,178,147,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
