His third Warner Bros. album contains a number of radio-friendly tracks clearly aimed at the singles market and few clues of the serious, brooding melancholy of Astral Weeks. Kicking off with the jaunty &quot;Domino,&quot; the album is generally dominated by uptempo swingers such as &quot;Call Me Up in Dreamland,&quot; &quot;Give Me a Kiss,&quot; and &quot;Blue Money.&quot; The cover photography and liner notes by then wife Janet Planet reveal a smiling Morrison and hint at a newfound personal contentment. This mood did not last long after Van left the artists' community of Woodstock. But even here, in &quot;I'll Be Your Lover Too&quot; and &quot;Crazy Face,&quot; there are moments that are essential listening for fans of his sullen splendor and mysticism. ---Rob Stewart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:535b81071219007edcd32651e0365a2f74f41b05","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+His+Band+And+Street+Choir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"535b81071219007edcd32651e0365a2f74f41b05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,91,129,7,18,25,0,126,220,211,38,81,224,54,90,47,116,244,27,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
