Bored of OP gears and unbalanced situations? Well we did! So we made an &quot;oldschool&quot; server! No packs/gear in cashshop! Unable to obtain R9, or bigger amounts of attack/defense level gems! Mediocre rates, daily free goodies, and proffessional GMs with 4+ years of experience!\n\n - all rates 10x, drop 6x\n - all classes, genies, everything!\n - PvE server, but highly encouraged and rewarded PvP with daily rewards! PvP rankings and rewards for top PKers soon!\n - Cheap cashshop with daily free charms/hieros, dolls/scrolls, teleport stones, mounts and much, much more! (Redeemable on the website, automatically, realtime)\n - Automatic events like Tigers, CoA(Netherbeast city) etc. are running properly + daily GM controlled events!\n - High performance server located in a serverpark, central Europe.\n - Our own, unique launcher downloading, updating, and maintaining the game. Wont interrupt with any other version of PW.\n - All instances, TWs, events etc working properly.\n - Fast support, you can often find the GMs on our Teamspeak server!\n\n - All groups who join our server with 4+ people get free &quot;Explorers kit&quot; upon reaching lvl15.
