RoboForm Enterprise will only recognize\n          valid URLs that are associated with login information.

The Virtual Keyboard is an image\n          of a keyboard on the screen in which users click the images of\n          the keyboard buttons. Since there are no keystrokes, there's\n          nothing for the keylogger to detect or transmit.\n \n \n        Portability\n \n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A portable version, RoboForm2Go, is available to run from a USB\n          Flash Drive.

It reduces their numerous logins to one master\n          password, making your employees more productive while saving\n          significant time and IT costs for your organization.\n \n \n        Increased Employee Productivity &amp; Satisfaction with a Single,\n        Secure Login to All Applications\n \n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Reduces the time-consuming login process and automatically logs\n          users into the business applications they use every day.

Users can be up and running quickly with little\n          to no training required.\n \n \n        Instant IT Savings, Reducing the Burden on Helpdesk Staff\n \n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The self-service nature of RoboForm Enterprise, translates\n          directly into instant relief for your IT or helpdesk staff\n          since they are no longer disrupted by employees? numerous\n          password re-set requests.\n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Enables you to enforce strong password policies that your\n          employees will actually follow. Your company can take advantage\n          of stronger password management practices, while staying\n          focused on more critical enterprise IT projects.\n \n \n        Cost-Effective with Rapid ROI\n \n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Is licensed per user at a reasonable price point at a fraction\n          of the cost of traditional SSO solutions, with volume discounts\n          available. \n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Helps you realize significant savings and immediate ROI with\n          more productive employees and with significant IT cost\n          reduction by eliminating help desk calls to reset passwords. In\n          many cases, this factor alone helps you quickly recover the\n          low-cost, up-front investment in purchasing the software.\n \n        Most companies experience a positive ROI in less than three\n        months just from help desk savings!\n \n \n        Immediate Results with Fast and Easy Roll Out, No Integration or\n        Infrastructure Changes\n \n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Offers a simplified implementation process so that the software\n          can be up and running in minutes.\n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Administrators have the flexibility to mass rollout as well as\n          quickly customize and control password settings as needed.\n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Does not require you to hire a team of consultants to plan and\n          implement, nor integrate or make changes to your application\n          infrastructure.\n \n \n \n        How It Works:\n \n        The trouble with strict password policies is that employees won't\n        follow them.

After installation make\n        sure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer\n        windows are closed or else the file will not copy over properly\n        (as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into safe mode if\n        you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll and roboform-x64.dll\n        (x64 dll is only needed for IE 64bit!) into AI Roboform's\n        installed folder, making sure to overwrite the existing files.\n        AI Roboform is now in the full PRO version with Enterprise\n        features.\n \n        Included is the Enterprise policies tool with this release so you\n        don't need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the\n        PolicyEditor folder.\n \n        Feel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when\n        you run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a\n        taskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known\n        as RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.\n        In IE 64bit it may show as Desktop ONLY in the about window, but\n        if you have chosen Everywhere syncing is still performed\n        (hopefully fixed in an update).  Its suggested to use a different\n        RoboForm Everywhere password than your master password.  This way\n        nobody will be able to decrypt your online database except you.\n\n        Note that you can now choose either Everywhere or Desktop type of\n        installation while first installing AI Roboform.  You can also\n        tell which type of configuration its currently set at by opening\n        the About window from the taskbar icon, keep this running if you\n        want full time syncing with Everywhere.  Everywhere will show\n        Sync With [USERNAME], while Desktop will not show Sync.  This can\n        be changed at any time by going into Options then User Data and\n        clicking on Settings button.\n\n\n        ** READ NFO NOTE: **\n\n        AI Roboform now includes support for Internet Explorer 64bit.\n        Only users with a 64bit OS need to copy over the extra precracked\n        dll (roboform-x64.dll) to AI Roboform's installed folder.\n \n        Thats it!
