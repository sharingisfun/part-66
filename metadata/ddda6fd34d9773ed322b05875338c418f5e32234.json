The extra space\navailable without a piano or guitar and bass really inspires them to investigate\nboth free jazz and interesting melodies. &quot;Salutations&quot; introduces the album at a\nslow pace, with the musicians checking each other out and setting the stage for\nthe rest of the album. Once they are warmed up, the title track follows with a\nvery exciting performance and the two musicians are almost giddy with the\npossibilities. The possibilities are exciting indeed, like using some subtle\noverdubbing on the beautiful melody of Duke Ellington's classic &quot;Creole Love\nCall&quot; before moving on to a spontaneous and bracing improvisation. &quot;Elephants\nare Afraid of Mice&quot; is another rousing improvisation, their partnership is very\nproductive, acting like dance partners on a skewed and ever changing dance\nfloor. This alluring in-the-moment feel is also captured by &quot;Cheryl&quot; where Blake\nand Osgood move on pure instinct through a free jazz performance filled with\nimpromptu spirit. A hidden track at the end of the album captures the to\nmusicians convulsing in uncontrollable laughter, and this giddiness and bonhomie\nsuffuses the entire album with devil may care excitement.\n\n--\n\nby Massimo Ricci\n\nby Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=32621&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=32621&lt;/a&gt;\n\ndi Angelo Leonardi (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3356&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3356&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddda6fd34d9773ed322b05875338c418f5e32234","amp;dn":"Michael+Blake%2C+Kresten+Osgood+-+Control+This+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddda6fd34d9773ed322b05875338c418f5e32234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,218,111,211,77,151,115,237,50,43,5,135,83,56,196,24,245,227,34,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
