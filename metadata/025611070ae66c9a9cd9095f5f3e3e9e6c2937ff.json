At age twelve, he ran away in a steam locomotive together with a blind 10-year-old girl. The engine derailed, and the little girl got killed. Feelings of guilt haunt Bo even in his courtship with Eva, a beautiful local girl. In Stockholm, Bo sees a nightmare about plotting to kill his roommate GÃƒÂ¶ran together with GÃƒÂ¶ran's flirtatious girlfriend Susanne. In a third act, Eva and Bo are married and living on a remote island off Stockholm. When it's time to give birth, Bo has to row the stormy seas and fears again that he will cause another death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:025611070ae66c9a9cd9095f5f3e3e9e6c2937ff","amp;dn":"Eva+%2F+Eva+%281948%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"025611070ae66c9a9cd9095f5f3e3e9e6c2937ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,86,17,7,10,230,108,154,156,217,9,95,95,62,62,158,108,41,55,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
