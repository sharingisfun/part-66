Armed to the teeth with futuristic gravity-controlling weapons, the Lutadore easily overrun the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defenses. Unbeknownst to all, mysterious anomalies have surfaced in conjunction with the invasion. Random regions in the city have entered zero gravity or have suffered vector changes, throwing the world into topsy-turvy chaos. Assuming the role of Davis Russel, a hotheaded 28-year-old cop, or Leo Delgado, DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ neighbor, players will embark on a journey through the disorienting war-ravaged, gravity twisted streets of their home town and beyond, to find DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ missing child.\n\n[b]Features:[/b]\n\n- Multiplayer Options: Play through the compelling story on your own or play with others in either co-op or competitive modes.\n- Breakthrough Gravity-Defying Gameplay: Learn to maneuver and shoot in an ever-changing state of global gravity, including weightless gameplay in zero gravity.
