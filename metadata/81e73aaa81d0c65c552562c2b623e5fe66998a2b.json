I love the MArk I line-up to death, maybe even more than the MArk II line up :). Anyways, couldn't find a torrent with this, so made one myself. This is the only 'decent' sounding live album I could find of the Mark I lineup, if anyone knows of any others, please leave a comment about it :D\n\nArtist: Deep Purple\nAlbum: Live At Inglewood 1968\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81e73aaa81d0c65c552562c2b623e5fe66998a2b","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Live+At+Inglewood+1968+%5B%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81e73aaa81d0c65c552562c2b623e5fe66998a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,231,58,170,129,208,198,92,85,37,98,194,182,35,229,254,102,153,138,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
