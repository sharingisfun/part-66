I tried to open my own lemonade stand but New York City made it difficult. The government said I had to pass a 15-hour food protection class, which included questions about barracuda and puffer fish.\nTonight, we revisit some guests from &quot;Illegal Everything&quot; and others who have to deal with the piles of laws, which, at the federal level alone, now total 160,000 pages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a882023adae2ef3cbb05d0a2c974945bd8c1c897","amp;dn":"20120308-Stossel-%5BToo+Many+Laws%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a882023adae2ef3cbb05d0a2c974945bd8c1c897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,130,2,58,218,226,239,60,187,5,208,162,201,116,148,91,216,193,200,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
