This 27-year-old director's B&amp;W film won two top awards ' the best film award in the fiction category and the IDPA award for the best first film by a director. It was not surprising to see it winning these two awards. Barve's 40-minute film deserves every ounce of the praise it got at the festival, despite its loud background score and somewhat tardy ending.\n\nA mentally-disturbed cop who is disturbed because he had been abused by his father as a child ' gets friendly with Ranka and takes Chimi on the pretext of buying her some sweets, only to sexually abuse her. Ranka finds her next morning at a construction site, lying half-dead, and the cop goes on to explain to him that such things keep happening, especially if it has to be with people of his kind of background, and it is best to forget about it and move on with life. But Ranka knows he has to protect his sister from monsters like the cop, and he takes his revenge, in the process losing whatever little innocence he has as a child. This more or less is the film's storyline, but the execution of the subject shows Barve is on firm ground.\n\n&quot;Manjha is an extraordinary film. With little resources it is visually stunning and emotionally captivating,&quot; Boyle said on his decision. &quot;I'm delighted to include Manjha on the Blu-ray DVD release of Slumdog Millionaire throughout the world.&quot;\n\nParental Warning - &quot;Abusive Language used in some scenes&quot;\n\nCast:\nDeepak Damle \nGaurav Kamble \nParvati Shankar \nGanesh Mayekar \nPrerana Barve\n\nMedia Info:\nLanguage - Hindi with Marathi \nSubtitles - Spanish/English hardsubs\nVideo Size - 214 MB\nVideo Codec - XviD\nVideo Res - 640 x 336\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps \nVideo Bitrate - 730 Kbps\nAudio Codec - MP3\nChannels - Stereo\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 41 mins\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAoclAaDC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAoclAaDC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mAOcmaadc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mAOcmaadc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/maOcnaaDC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/maOcnaaDC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naOCaaaDc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naOCaaaDc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naoCbAaDc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naoCbAaDc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naocDAADc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naocDAADc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAOCfaADC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAOCfaADC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAocGAaDC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAocGAaDC&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257df2aa0c6fdc8c4814788ce9f1f20fd470e7b4","amp;dn":"Manjha%7Eaka%7EKite+Thread%7E2008%7EShort+Film%7EE-Subs%7EPhantom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257df2aa0c6fdc8c4814788ce9f1f20fd470e7b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,125,242,170,12,111,220,140,72,20,120,140,233,241,242,15,212,112,231,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
