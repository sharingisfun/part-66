These were deemed different enough, and interesting enough, to warrant inclusion and make this a semi &quot;archival&quot; issue as well.\n\nAs with my Gunstar Heroes OSV remaster, I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an &quot;album&quot;.\n\nThis collection of audio does NOT in any way duplicate audio from any other Sonic The Hedgehog 2 music CD.\n\n\n---------------\n\n\nSonic The Hedgehog 2 Soundtrack (Original Sound Version)\n\nFoobar VGM HQ WAV dumps -&gt; post-processing/mastering by Vertiphon\n\nComposed by Masato Nakamura &amp; Izuho Takeuchi.\nCopyright 1992 Sega / Sonic Team.\nVertiphon 2012 remaster.\n\n\n01 Sonic 2 Theme  0:12\n02 Options  0:34\n03 Emerald Hill Zone  1:40\n04 Act Clear  0:10\n05 Chemical Plant Zone  2:04\n06 Robotnik's Theme  1:25\n07 Aquatic Ruin Zone  1:17\n08 Casino Night Zone  1:56\n09 Hill Top Zone  1:39\n10 Mystic Cave Zone  2:03\n11 Oil Ocean Zone  1:41\n12 Metropolis Zone  1:45\n13 Sky Chase Zone  1:30\n14 Wing Fortress Zone  1:47\n15 Death Egg Zone  1:55\n16 Final Boss  2:07\n17 Ending Theme  1:17\n18 Staff Roll  2:45\n19 Emerald Hill (2 Player)  1:28\n20 Casino Night (2 Player)  1:31\n21 Mystic Cave (2 Player)  2:01\n22 2 Player Results  1:36\n23 Special Stage  1:40\n24 Chaos Emerald  0:06\n25 Super Sonic  0:55\n26 Extra Life  0:06\n27 Invincibility  0:34\n28 Drowning  0:15\n29 Continue  0:12\n30 Game Over  0:16\n31 Untitled (Sound Test 10)  1:53\n32 Casino Night Zone (Beta Version)  2:29\n33 Metropolis Zone (Beta Version)  1:49\n34 Death Egg Zone (Beta Version)  1:43\n35 Robotnik (Beta Version)  1:29\n\n\nThe files are in 24-bit 44.1 kHz lossless FLAC audio format.\n\nThis soundtrack has been created with gapless play in mind.\nDo not add gaps if you burn to a CD as audio.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:605b70222e76d1e7ccd6e627de0035815043bac3","amp;dn":"Sega+-+Sonic+The+Hedgehog+2+%28Vertiphon+2012+Remaster%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"605b70222e76d1e7ccd6e627de0035815043bac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,91,112,34,46,118,209,231,204,214,230,39,222,0,53,129,80,67,186,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
