If language is a glorious garden, filled with exotic hybrids as well as traditional heritage specimens, then weeds will also thrive on its fertile grounds. Linguistic weeds may be defined as pronunciations or constructions that are no longer used. For example, Burridge points out how &quot;aint&quot; or double negatives were at one time quite acceptable in everyday speaking and writing but are now classified as &quot;weeds&quot; that should no longer have a place in our vocabulary. And, as she so deftly accomplished in Blooming English, Burridge goes on here to further celebrate our capacity to play with language, and to examine the ways we use it: in slang and jargon, swearing, speaking the unspeakable, or concealing unpleasant or inconvenient facts. In this new volume she gives us another fun and informative work for enjoyable browsing; for discovering intriguing trivia about language, history, and social customs; and for employing as a peerless weapon in word games. Kate Burridge is the Chair of Linguistics at Monash University and a regular presenter of segments on the Australian Broadcast Company.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bd8fb7b1a6c94197828d984cd69b889a300ee0d","amp;dn":"Weeds+in+the+Garden+of+Words%3A+Further+Observations+on+the+Tangle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bd8fb7b1a6c94197828d984cd69b889a300ee0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,216,251,123,26,108,148,25,120,40,217,132,205,105,184,137,163,0,238,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
