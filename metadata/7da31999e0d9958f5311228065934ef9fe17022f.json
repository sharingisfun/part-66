Yadin uncovered a cache of ancient documents, human skulls, and artifacts that shed light on a legendary revolt by Jews against the Roman Empire in the year 132. The uprising, led by Jewish patriot Shimon Bar-Kokhba, is said to have resulted in the Roman slaughter of 580,000 Jews. NOVA explores the last refuge of one group of Bar-Kokhba's followers with an historian whose bold theories have rocked the world of biblical archeology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da31999e0d9958f5311228065934ef9fe17022f","amp;dn":"NOVA+%28PBS%29+Ancient+Refuge+-+In+the+Holy+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da31999e0d9958f5311228065934ef9fe17022f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,163,25,153,224,217,149,143,83,17,34,128,101,147,78,249,254,23,2,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
