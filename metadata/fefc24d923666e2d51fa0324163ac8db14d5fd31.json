A03.  I have used this to install things like network, disk, audio drivers for my Dimension 2400 and 4800.\n\nDell's website is such a clunker I thought it would be nice to offer a complete resource for you guys trying to beat older computers into submission!\n\nIt will likely work for more than just 2400 and 4800, as Dimension boards have a lot of the same parts.\n\nTo use, either install a .iso mounter program, or burn it to a disk with the many free .iso utilities.  Windows 7 even has .iso burning built in.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fefc24d923666e2d51fa0324163ac8db14d5fd31","amp;dn":"Dell+Dimension+Series+Resource+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fefc24d923666e2d51fa0324163ac8db14d5fd31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,252,36,217,35,102,110,45,81,250,3,36,22,58,200,219,20,213,253,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
