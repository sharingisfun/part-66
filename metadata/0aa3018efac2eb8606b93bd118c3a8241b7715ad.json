It is a heart-warming account of the Easter story as seen through the eyes of a lovable pig (Horace), a faint-hearted horse (Monty), a pedantic rat (Slink), a rambling rooster (Drake), a motherly cow (Esmay) and a downtrodden donkey (Jack). This magnificent period piece with its epic sets is a roller coaster ride of emotions. Enveloped in humor, this quest follows the animals from the stable in Bethlehem to the great temple in Jerusalem and onto the hillside of Calvary as these unlikely heroes try to save their friend. The journey weaves seamlessly through the biblical accounts of Palm Sunday, Jesus turning the tables in the temple, PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s denial and with a tense, heart-wrenching climax, depicts the crucifixion and resurrection with gentleness and breathtaking beautyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nGenre: Animation\nIMDB rating: 3.2/10\nDirected by: Deryck Broom, Roger Hawkins\nStarring: Michael Madsen, Ernest Borgnine and Leon Clingman\n\nRelease Name: The.Lion.of.Judah.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-HD4U\nSize: 2.7 GB\nVideo: x264 | 1280Ãƒâ€”720 | 2833Kbps\nAudio: English | DTS | 1509 kbps\nRuntime: 1h 27m\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa3018efac2eb8606b93bd118c3a8241b7715ad","amp;dn":"The.Lion.of.Judah.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-HD4U","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa3018efac2eb8606b93bd118c3a8241b7715ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,163,1,142,250,194,235,134,6,185,59,209,24,195,168,36,27,119,21,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
