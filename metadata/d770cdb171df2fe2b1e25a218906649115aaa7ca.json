The Fallen Angels were formed in 1966 and recorded two LPs for the Roulette label. Both of the albums have been re-released on separate CDs as The Roulette Masters, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. The music of the Fallen Angels was aimed for a pop audience as the label was trying to repeat the success of its major act, Tommy James &amp; the Shondells. It proved that the Fallen Angels were much to &quot;far out&quot; for the commercial radio audience, and despite good sales of the first album, the band was dropped by their label after recording a second album entitled It's a Long Way Down. Both albums remain prime examples of psychedelic pop music which many band's in the late 90s are trying to copy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d770cdb171df2fe2b1e25a218906649115aaa7ca","amp;dn":"The+Fallen+Angels+-++The+Roulette+Masters+Part+2+Of+2+%281968%2F1994","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d770cdb171df2fe2b1e25a218906649115aaa7ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,112,205,177,113,223,47,226,177,226,90,33,137,6,100,145,21,170,167,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
