It was created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson.\n\nSteven Moffat wrote the first episode, \\&quot;A Study in Pink\\&quot;, loosely based upon A Study in Scarlet. Coky Giedroyc had directed a 60 minute version of the episode, but it had to be reshot when the BBC commissioned episodes of 90 minutes duration. The revised version of \\&quot;A Study in Pink\\&quot;, directed by Paul McGuigan, was first broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD on 25 July 2010.[42][43]\nThe second episode, \\&quot;The Blind Banker\\&quot; in which Holmes is hired by an old friend to investigate a mysterious break-in at a bank in the City, was written by Stephen Thompson and directed by Euros Lyn.[44] The first series concluded with \\&quot;The Great Game\\&quot;, which was first broadcast on 8 August 2010. The episode introduces the character of Jim Moriarty to the series (Andrew Scott), who sets Holmes deadlines to solve a series of apparently unrelated cases. Written by Mark Gatiss and directed by McGuigan, \\&quot;The Great Game\\&quot; ends in a cliffhanger in which Sherlock and Moriarty reach a standoff involving a bomb strapped to Watson.\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nTorrent contents:\n\n1x01 \\'A Study In Pink\\'.mkv\n1x02 \\'The Blind Banker\\'.mkv\n1x03 \\'The Great Game\\'.mkv\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nPlease seed and enjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0d9a80e2cb5dd2bb05a2996a136b12c686f9e7e","amp;dn":"BBC+Sherlock+-+Series+1+-+720p+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0d9a80e2cb5dd2bb05a2996a136b12c686f9e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,217,168,14,44,181,221,43,176,90,41,150,161,54,177,44,104,111,158,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
