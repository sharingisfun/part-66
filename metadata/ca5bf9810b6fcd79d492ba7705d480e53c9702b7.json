En route, a member of his team turns out to be a traitor and shoots Jon in the head while kidnapping the scientist. When Jon wakes up in the hospital, a doctor tells him that within weeks, the bullet in his brain will cause complete paralysis. Jon returns to Beijing to see his mother, who confesses that Jon has a brother in Malaysia who was raised by his father, a gambler. Jon takes a flight to Malaysia to find his brother, Yeung. On the plane he forms a bond with Dr. Kan, who promises to look into possible treatments for his condition. However, when they arrive, Yeung tries to kidnap the doctor and when Jon intervenes, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also taken hostage. The two soon realize theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re brothers, and decide to work together in order to keep the criminals behind the kidnappings from reinfecting the world of a disease long thought cured.\n\nGenre: Action | Drama\nIMDB rating: 6.3/10 from 430 users\nDirected by: Dante Lam\nStarring: Carl Ng, Bing Bai and Jay Chou\n\nRelease Name: The.Viral.Factor.2012.BDRip.HC.SUBS.Ac3.XviD-ANALOG\nSize: 1.82 GiB\nVideo: XviD | 720Ãƒâ€”304 | 1 738 Kbps\nAudio: English,Cantonese | AC-3 | 384 Kbps\nRuntime: 2h 2mn\nSubtitles: Hardcoded/Embeded.English\n\nSource : Bluray(BD50) \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5bf9810b6fcd79d492ba7705d480e53c9702b7","amp;dn":"The.Viral.Factor.2012.BDRip.HC.SUBS.AC3.XviD-ANALOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5bf9810b6fcd79d492ba7705d480e53c9702b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,91,249,129,11,111,205,121,212,146,186,119,5,212,128,229,60,151,2,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
