In fact, if there is one criticism of the\nfilm, it is that insufficient time is allowed for all these\nelements to develop and cohere. I've read some reviews which\njudge Ruiz' film to be &quot;technically excellent&quot; but at the same\ntime &quot;cold and distant&quot;. While this may be true for many of Ruiz'\nworks, I don't find it so for Le Domaine Perdu, and of all his\nfilms I think that this is the most emotionally involving,\nespecially the devastating final section.\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
