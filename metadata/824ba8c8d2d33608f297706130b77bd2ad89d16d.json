ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your responsibility not only to buy spare parts, but also to design the car and to recruit the members of your team. And then, you have to decide which training sessions are the most appropriate for your pilots. Pole Position 2012 offers you more features than ever in a Formula 1 racing team management simulation. The whole technology tree was revised from the ground up and you have to pick your own research from over 100 new technology projects. The team management system is easier to use and is even more interesting. And even when it comes to your own satisfaction, you can make your dreams come true and get a sports car, a villa or even a private jet plane. But it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter how you build your racing team, your goal is always the same: make the right choices, pick the right people and win the World Championship!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824ba8c8d2d33608f297706130b77bd2ad89d16d","amp;dn":"Pole+Position+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824ba8c8d2d33608f297706130b77bd2ad89d16d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,75,168,200,210,211,54,8,242,151,112,97,48,183,123,210,173,137,209,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
