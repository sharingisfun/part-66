If there is a big demand for it, I will make a comparable DVD in some other format, but I don't expect that to happen -- the video is about worldwide revolution, but it is focused mostly on the USA, where I live. \n\n\nThe entire video can be watched ata web location that can be reached more easily through the alias http://reveal-revolt.org.
