Amidst his friendships with Scotch Evans, a ribald nightlife correspondent; Ozzy, a troubled but loving heroin addict; and Kate Hardwick, a bewitching, quick-witted reporter, Jack sinks deeper into depression. Haunted by lost-love and his mother's suicide, Jack plunges into whiskey and self-destruction . . . until his eleven-year-old neighbor, Sophie, an unlikely mother figure, leads Jack back into himself, and out of the nostalgia and excess that consumed him. \n\n\nReleased:\tMay 05, 2010\nRuntime:\t92 mins \nGenres:\tComedy Drama Romance \n\n\nCountries:\tUSA \n\n\nDirector:\tSteve Clark\n\n\nActors:\t\nAshley Greenfield Carlos Velazquez Jason Behr Krysten Ritter Lucy Gordon MarÃƒÂ­a Jurado Monet Mazur Robert Bogue\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d53d36cb646d41df0508d662a3e6df244439e7c1","amp;dn":"The+Last+International+Playboy++%5BDVDRip%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d53d36cb646d41df0508d662a3e6df244439e7c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,61,54,203,100,109,65,223,5,8,214,98,163,230,223,36,68,57,231,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
