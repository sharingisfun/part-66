It was released in 2003 and is the sequel to the best-selling 2001 game Final Fantasy X. The game's story follows the character Yuna from Final Fantasy X as she seeks to resolve political conflicts in the fictional world of Spira before it leads to war.\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 set several precedents in the Final Fantasy series aside from being the first direct sequel in video game form and the second sequel in the franchise, after the anime Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals. It was the first game in the series to feature only three playable characters, an all-female main cast, and early access to most of the game's locations. Additionally, it featured a variation of the character classes systemÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the series' classic gameplay conceptsÃ¢â‚¬â€and is one of the few games in the series to feature multiple endings. Finally, it was the first Final Fantasy game in the series that didn't have any musical contributions in it from longtime composer Nobuo Uematsu.\n\nThe game was positively received by critics and was commercially successful. After nine months of being released in Japan, it sold a million copies in North America, and approximately four million copies worldwide. Final Fantasy X-2 was voted as the 32nd best game of all time by the readers of Famitsu. The English version of the game won an award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance&quot; at the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences in 2004. The game has attained a rating of 86% on Game Rankings and an 85% rating on Metacritic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eace133d9f132dc949e5fafa27777de180309e4c","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+X-2+From+Cerberus+Team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eace133d9f132dc949e5fafa27777de180309e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,206,19,61,159,19,45,201,73,229,250,250,39,119,125,225,128,48,158,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
