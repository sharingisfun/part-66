His organization, headquartered in Brooklyn, stretched across more than 20 states, and he became the only Black gangster to establish direct ties to the French Connection heroin pipeline. After being indicted in 1973, he disappeared with 15-20 million dollars in drug profits, equivalent to roughly 100 million in today's cash. Despite one of the largest manhunt's in US history, Frank Matthews hasn't been seen since. There is no proof of whether he is alive or dead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d9b59ca4bfa6a225be2a172d40c49416d732123","amp;dn":"The+Frank+Matthews+Story+1gb.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d9b59ca4bfa6a225be2a172d40c49416d732123","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,155,89,202,75,250,106,34,91,226,161,114,212,12,73,65,109,115,33,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
