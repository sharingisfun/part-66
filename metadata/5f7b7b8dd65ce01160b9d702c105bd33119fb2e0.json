Amazing re-edit of Kenobi and Vaders battle... the list goes on and on.  Has to be seen to believed, as everyone says 'this is what the Special Editions SHOULD have been'.\n\nIf you can, get hold of the 4gb+ full DVD9 version - plays just like an official Star Wars disc with menus etc. and the picture is the best I have ever seen in the DVD format, full-stop.\n\nAlso note that this .AVI version is compressed so doesn't do justice to the amazing work that's been done - to reiterate; get the full DVD9 version!!\n\nAs ever with Fanedits, make sure you own a copy of Star Wars before downloading this or any other alternative version.\n\nFor more info on Adywan and his work - \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f7b7b8dd65ce01160b9d702c105bd33119fb2e0","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Revisited+%28Fanedit+by+Adywan+-+DVD9+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f7b7b8dd65ce01160b9d702c105bd33119fb2e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,123,123,141,214,92,224,17,96,185,215,2,193,5,189,51,17,159,178,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
