Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers.\n\nNow, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster.\n\nOn his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockstargames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockstargames.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3c42077af88a49be0eb092414c87390fe9a5c95","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+-+San+Andreas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3c42077af88a49be0eb092414c87390fe9a5c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,196,32,119,175,136,164,155,224,235,9,36,20,200,115,144,254,154,92,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
