YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet Jillian, a house wife who discovers she has a natural case of road rage. Sharron, a comedienne who wants to ditch public transport for her own set of wheels but she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to keep the car straight. Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Angyl, a model with a mean case of the driving jitters.\n\nAll the near misses and accidents taped along the way guarantee a nail-biting driving experience, so buckle-up and prepare for some of the worst drivers ever.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18085f46dc7cdc5acf0f5f51baf35ace687dca68","amp;dn":"last.chance.driving.school.s01e01.highway.to.hell.hdtv.x264-cldd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18085f46dc7cdc5acf0f5f51baf35ace687dca68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,8,95,70,220,124,220,90,207,15,95,81,186,243,90,206,104,125,202,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
