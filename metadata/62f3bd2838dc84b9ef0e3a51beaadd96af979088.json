If you use these in place of what gets installed with Oblivion by default, it will help to improve performance.  \n\nOblivion - Meshes.bsa was pyffi'd by somebody over on http://bbs.3dmgame.com/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&amp;fid=197&amp;page=1 (Chinese website, I can't read their moon-runes, good luck).  The rest were pyffi'd by snarfies of loverslab.com using pyffi 2.1.11.\n\nI am providing this simply because running pyffi can take a LONG time - we're talking a few hours on an Intel Q9450 (that's what I have).  Their distribution is almost certainly a copyright violation.  But I'm pretty sure Bethesda has already made a mint off of Oblivion since 2006 and is now focused on Skyrim, so I don't feel too badly about it at this point.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f3bd2838dc84b9ef0e3a51beaadd96af979088","amp;dn":"Uncompressed+pyffi+meshes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f3bd2838dc84b9ef0e3a51beaadd96af979088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,243,189,40,56,220,132,185,239,14,58,81,190,170,221,150,175,151,144,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
