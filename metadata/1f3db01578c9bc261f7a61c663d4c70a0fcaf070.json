In Future Weapons, former Navy SEAL Richard &quot;Mack&quot; Machowicz goes in search of the latest, cleverest and most terrifying technology already reaching out to dominate the battlefields of the 21st century. He introduces viewers to weapons that seek out targets almost on their own; others that tap new forms of destructive power; and a few that push the limits of overwhelming force.\n\n\n1)  No Place To Hide \nFrom guns that shoot around corners to the world's most advanced supersonic jet fighter - these weapons leave the enemy no place to hide. Even worse, the enemy has no way of defending himself because he can't see where the attack is coming from! If you think you're safe - in a bunker, behind a wall or under armor plate - think again, especially when you run into the long-range gun of the mighty Panzer Howitzer.\n\n2)  Stealth \nModern warfare is about creeping up on your target unseen. To be invincible, it's good to be invisible. As a former Navy SEAL, host Richard Machowicz knows all about the dark and secretive world of stealth technology. Mack scores a world exclusive when he goes head to head with the notorious Predator, the silent aerial assassin. Then, Mack's on more familiar ground when he handles the formidable Barrett M107 rifle, loaded with new military-grade munitions that out-snipe the sniper - from nearly 2 miles away.\n\n3)  Maximum Impact \nIn a breathtaking display of firepower, this episode of Future Weapons reveals the most powerful conventional weapons yet devised. Capable of unleashing a million rounds a minute, Metal Storm is the most destructive automatic gun ever created. The thermobaric bomb is designed to use a lethal combination of flame, pressure and suffocation. This state-of-the-art bomb reaches deep into caves, creating an enormous bone-crushing blast, which is quickly followed by a firestorm that leaves nothing but charred landscape in its wake. The Multiple Rocket Launch System fires off a barrage of missiles against its target with such ferocity and speed that it guarantees total destruction. Where before stood an army, now only shadows remain.\n\n4)  Future Shock \nPeer into the future with weapons - including powerful lasers and EMP bombs - that are more subtle and sinister than anything ever before. Former Navy SEAL Richard Machowicz reveals the weapons that military units will fight with in future battles. More sinister and subtle than anything that's been seen before, these weapons can destroy entire cities in the blink of an eye. The EMP bomb paralyzes a city with an invisible electromagnetic pulse, sending civilization back into the dark ages. The LRAD weapon strikes down human targets with low frequency noise; and powerful lasers take the place of bombs and bullets, when a laser mounted in a plane incinerates other planes and ground targets at the speed of light. The future has arrived!\n\n5)  Smart Weapons \nIn the deserts of Arizona, Mack gets a close-up look at Excalibur - a smart 155mm cannon-fired projectile that guides its own flight trajectory. It can hit its target from 25 miles away, to within 10 yards! Thor is a new missile system that beats the 10-second attack window, allowing helicopters to strike ground targets within seconds. But the stakes are raised when Mack goes on a midnight exercise with the new Apache Longbow, which can take out targets that are way out of sight and network with a brigade of choppers to create an airborne superweapon.\n\n6)  The Power of Fear \nThe sensor fuzed weapon is a smart bomb that splits into dozens of tiny but lethal airborne tank busters, capable of reducing a tank column to mere shrapnel. And if it's fear that's required, reach for the MOAB. Short for Massive Ordnance Air Blast, the MOAB has never been dropped in action. Yet its very presence makes the enemy quake. Weighing in at 20 tons, it's the biggest conventional bomb ever made, and it's capable of taking out underground concrete command and control centers - or two whole city blocks.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img855/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img855/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img521/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img521/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img802/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img802/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img21/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img21/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img444/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img444/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img192/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img192/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img835/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img835/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img9/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img9/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img20/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img20/2107/futureweaponsseason1scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1960 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2ch\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime per Part 43.mins\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/futureweapons/bio/bio.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/futureweapons/bio/bio.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Top%20Ten%20Combat%20Rifles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Top%20Ten%20Combat%20Rifles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Infantry%20Firepower&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Infantry%20Firepower&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Electronic%20Armageddon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Electronic%20Armageddon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Next%20World&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Next%20World&lt;/a&gt;\n\n3)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Future_Weapons%3A_Season_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Future_Weapons%3A_Season_1&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f3db01578c9bc261f7a61c663d4c70a0fcaf070","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Future+Weapons+Season+1+3of6+Maximum+Impact+XviD+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f3db01578c9bc261f7a61c663d4c70a0fcaf070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,61,176,21,120,201,188,38,31,122,97,198,99,212,199,10,15,202,240,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
