And though she's prepared to fight her way into an elitist boys' club, or duck the occasional errant football, she quickly realizes she's in over her head when she's relegated to a kiddie-size folding chair with her new monikerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½GirlieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½inscribed in Wite-Out across the back.\n\nNo matter. She's determined to make it in bond sales at Cromwell Pierce, one of the Street's most esteemed brokerage firms. Keeping her eyes on the prize, the low Girlie on the totem pole will endure whatever comes her wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½whether trekking to the Bronx for a $1,000 wheel of Parmesan cheese; discovering a secretary's secret Friday night slumber/dance party in the conference room; fielding a constant barrage of &quot;friendly&quot; practical jokes; learning the ropes from Chick, her unpredictable, slightly scary, loyalty-demanding boss; babysitting a colleague while he consumes the contents of a vending machine on a $28,000 bet; or eluding the advances of a corporate stalker who's also one of the firm's biggest clients.\n\nIgnoring her friends' pleas to quit, Alex excels (while learning how to roll with the punches and laugh at herself) and soon advances from lowly analyst to slightly-less-lowly associate. Suddenly, she's addressed by her real name, and the impenetrable boys' club has transformed into forty older brothers and one possible boyfriend. Then the apocalypse hits, and Alex is forced to choose between sticking with Cromwell Pierce as it teeters on the brink of disaster or kicking off her Jimmy Choos and running for higher ground.\n\nFast-paced, funny, and thoroughly addictive, Bond Girl will leave you cheering for Alex: a feisty, ambitious woman with the spirit to stand up to the best (and worst) of the boys on the StreetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and ultimately rise above them all.\n\n\nNote:  the pictures in the book look faded that's just how they were.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbe21a725072b449921e6581d2440caa47cc6f98","amp;dn":"Erin+Duffy+-+Bond+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbe21a725072b449921e6581d2440caa47cc6f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,226,26,114,80,114,180,73,146,30,101,129,210,68,12,170,71,204,111,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
