In the Saturday 9-10am slot, it gradually became one of Radio 4\\'s most successful programmes.\n\nThe show was essentially a talk show where the host would interview ordinary people with an extraordinary story to tell. There was also considerable correspondence with its listeners. Home Truths was based on a previous show called Offspring (which aired from 1995 to 1997), also hosted by Peel. Home Truths took essentially the same format as its predecessor, but widened the remit from talking about the relationship between parents and children to discussion of all aspects of life.\n\nIn the confessional format, John Peel was a gifted interviewer who succeeded in drawing humorous, quirky and sad stories out of listeners without sensationalising or resorting to mawkishness.\n\nAfter Peel\\'s death, the programme was presented by a series of guest presenters including Paul Heiney, writer David Stafford, comedian Linda Smith and musician Tom Robinson. However the programme was axed after the BBC decided that the formula did not work as well without Peel\\'s presence.\n\nThe last edition of Home Truths was presented by David Stafford and was broadcast on 24 June 2006.\n\n\nTaken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Truths","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81bbf180ba4e07b569ebf464defb06de91d3ce7","amp;dn":"Home+Truths+++%28BBC+2003+-+John+Peel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81bbf180ba4e07b569ebf464defb06de91d3ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,27,191,24,11,164,224,123,86,158,191,70,77,239,176,109,233,29,60,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
