What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 5 - Wednesday - The contestants are divided into two teams, and are challenged to create, make and bake an afternoon tea for 100 guests. It must include four dishes - a scone, a pastry, and two of their choice. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c4adb31c0433ed97de48a804e6d4de580a56a70","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E28.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c4adb31c0433ed97de48a804e6d4de580a56a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,74,219,49,192,67,62,217,125,228,138,128,78,109,77,229,128,165,106,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
