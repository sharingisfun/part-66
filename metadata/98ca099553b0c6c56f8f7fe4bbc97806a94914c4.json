Lovely, lovely people. I share their music because their albums are not available world-wide, it would seem.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.Caritas abundat in omnia (3:27) Hildegard von Bingen [XII]\n02.Cuncti simus concanentes (4:42) Llibre Vermell [XIV]\n03.Si dolce ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'l tormento (3:28) C. Monteverdi [XVI-XVII]\n04.Non e gran cousa (4:59) King Alfonso X cantiga [XIII]\n05.MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s vale trocar (3:54) Juan del Encina [XV-XVI]\n06.Canarios (3:20) Gaspar Sanz [XVII-XVIII]\n07.NiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o Dios de Amor herido (4:23) F. Guerrero [XVI]\n08.A que por muy gran fremosura (4:24) Alfonso X [XIII]\n09.O magnum mysterium (3:49) T. L.

I first fell in love with this album after seeing the absolutely AMAZING trailer for this album which you may find here.\n\nThis is definitely my kind of music, as I fell in love with the Benedictine Abess, Hildegard von Bingen, when I was quite young, much to the chargrin of my Pagan parents. \n\nCertainly, this music will not appeal to everyone. But I do hope that those who have a medieval soul will appreciate the authenticity of these lovely tracks, of James\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' deep voice and Maite\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s amazing soprano.\n\nThis is my first upload, as previously stated, if there are any errors, I am very sorry, and I invite you to message me regarding your questions comments and concerns.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98ca099553b0c6c56f8f7fe4bbc97806a94914c4","amp;dn":"Elfenthal+-+An+Ancient+Story%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98ca099553b0c6c56f8f7fe4bbc97806a94914c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,202,9,149,83,176,198,197,111,143,127,228,187,201,120,6,169,73,20,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
