I recently caught it on a repeat.\n\n\nEpisode description:\nFor aboriginal kids from reserves in northern Ontario, a high school diploma is a ticket to a better future. But a shocking number of these students have ended up dead before graduation.\n\nthe fifth estate's Gillian Findlay presents an extremely up-close and personal look inside the native secondary education program in Thunder Bay, Ont., where seven students have tragically died in the past ten years. Five of the victims died apparent alcohol related deaths -- their bodies were pulled from local rivers amid swirling suspicions and rumours about what pushed them over the edge. Another two teens suffered troubling and unexpected deaths that have left lingering questions. \n\nFilmed by a local crew with close connections to the community, with unprecedented access, the fifth estate takes viewers inside the school halls, the homes where the kids are billeted, the mall where they hang out, and onto the dark streets where their dedicated teachers and mentors run nightly patrols in a desperate bid to try and get them all home safe.\n\n\nShow description:\nCanadian television newsmagazine, airing on the English television network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Its primary focus is on investigative journalism, with some stories appearing on American News shows. \n\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name        : the.fifth.estate.s37e09.stories.from.the.rivers.edge.hdtv.x264-cldd.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 918 Kbps\nLength            : 296 MiB for 45mn 5s 68ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 772 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 400 (1.800) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 144 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9752478622da1a95c4a7c182ee689b9cb405727","amp;dn":"the.fifth.estate.s37e09.stories.from.the.rivers.edge.hdtv.x264-c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9752478622da1a95c4a7c182ee689b9cb405727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,117,36,120,98,45,161,169,92,74,124,24,46,230,137,185,203,64,87,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
