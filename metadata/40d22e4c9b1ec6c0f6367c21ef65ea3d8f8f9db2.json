September 22, 2011\n\nAsh has returned to Nimbasa City and is excited to finally have his Gym Battle to get his fourth badge. Shortly before wanting to walk towards the Gym, Bianca comes charging in and throws Ash, once again, in water. Ash wants to go into the Gym, but Bianca wants to battle first. Bianca talks about how the Gym Leader, Elesa, is a super model. They go to the Gym only to find out that she is in the middle of a fashion show and cannot battle at the moment. Bianca decides to take a look at the fashion show, and the others follow. They watch the show and Elesa notices Ash and his Pikachu. She jumps over to them and they introduce themselves to Elesa. Ash and Bianca explain to her that they are challengers and that they have come to challenge the Gym, but Elesa tells them to return after the fashion show is over. When they return to the Gym, they climb into a cart that they soon find out it is a roller coaster car. Once they reach the end of the roller coaster, they meet Elesa once again. Bianca claims that she had made an appointment for a Gym Battle and gets to battle first. However, Bianca's father shows up, having come to end Bianca's journey and take her home but, she refuses to go. Elesa suggests using the Gym Battle to prove how much she has grown. Bianca and her father agree that if she loses she will end her journey and go home. The battle between Bianca and Elesa is about to begin with a three on three battle. The gym leader calls out Zebstrika and Bianca calls out Shelmet. Bianca starts it off with Acid followed by Energy Ball, which both miss. Zebstrika uses Flame Charge followed by Double Kick which takes out Shelmet. Next is Mincinno. It uses Double Slap which misses, as well as Swift. Zebstrika uses Flame Charge and Mincinno uses Hyper Voice followed by Swift but misses. Zebstrika uses Flame Charge once again and hits Mincinno, taking it out. Next, Bianca calls out Pignite. It uses Flamethrower which misses. Zebstrika uses Double Kick which misses as well. Pignite uses Flame Charge which lands a direct hit and Zebstrika uses Flame Charge while Pignite counters with Flamethrower. Pignite uses Heat Crash which lands a direct hit. Zebstrika uses \nFlame Charge, once again, causing its speed to go up. Zebstrika immediately follows it up with Wild Charge and takes out Pignite. As promised, Bianca agrees to go home with her father. Before Bianca and her father return home, they have lunch with Ash, Iris, and Cilan. Ash convinces Bianca's father to have a battle wagering that if he wins, Bianca can continue traveling and if he loses, he will return to Kanto. Bianca's father claims that he was called the &quot;Red Meteor&quot; when he was younger, and calls out Darmanitan. Ash's Oshawott shows that he wants to \nbattle and Ash lets him. Bianca's father ultimately wins the match, but he realizes that traveling on a journey only makes one stronger and he agrees to let them continue traveling.  \n\n Spoken Language: English\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nCast\n-----------\n\nStars:UnshÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ Ishizuka, Rica Matsumoto and Ikue Ootani \n\n Series Cast\n\n UnshÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ Ishizuka ...
