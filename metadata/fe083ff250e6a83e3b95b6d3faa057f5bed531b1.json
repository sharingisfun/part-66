Herman Melville was only missing one thing when he wrote Moby Dick, and that was cheese (and a lot of it). Thankfully that Asylum has stepped in and rectified the situation. In this re-imagined masterpiece, Moby Dick has the ability to walk on land, the whaleship Pequod has been replaced with a high techsubmarine (which was actually shot on a spaceship set) and Barry Bostwick (Captain Ahab) gives a performance so 'over the to'p he makes Brian Blessed look subtle.\n\nCheck out more funny reviews at\nwww.bmovienews.net\n\n\nLink to the actual film &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/2010%20moby%20dick/0/99/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/2010%20moby%20dick/0/99/0&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe083ff250e6a83e3b95b6d3faa057f5bed531b1","amp;dn":"2010%3A+Moby+Dick+%282010%29+-+B+Movie+Comedy+Show+-+The+Asylum+-+Syfy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe083ff250e6a83e3b95b6d3faa057f5bed531b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,8,63,242,80,230,168,62,59,149,182,211,250,160,87,245,190,213,49,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
