Though underrated, \nhe is currently at the peak of his powers. Harrison worked with bassist Ron \nCarter, drummer Billy Cobham, and pianist James Williams in a 2002 quartet \ncalled the Art of Four. He reunites with Carter and Cobham for five \nselections on Heroes and also engages in three duets with the bassist. \nWhether it is a minor blues (&quot;One of a Kind&quot;), the &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; chords of \n&quot;Double Trouble,&quot; &quot;Solar,&quot; or the melancholy &quot;Candlelight,&quot; Harrison shows \nthat he is a superior post-bop improviser with a sound of his own. The final \nthree selections, listed as &quot;bonus tracks,&quot; have Harrison performing a funk \npiece, a calypso, and a mistitled Thelonious Monk tune (&quot;Well, You Needn't&quot; \nis listed as &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot;) in spirited fashion with bassist Vicente \nArcher and drummer John Lamkin. This CD is one of Donald Harrison's most \nrewarding showcases to date and is highly recommended. ~ allmusic.com\n\n\n\n[b]:: Release Info ::[/b]\nGenre: Jazz\nRunning Time: 1:05:04\nLabel: Nagel Heyer Records\nRecording Date: 2002 12 01+2002 12 02\nRelease Date: Apr 27, 2004\nUPC Code: 645347204126\n\n\n\n[b]:: Credits ::[/b]\nVicente Archer -  Bass \nRon Carter - Composer \nBilly Cobham - Drums \nMiles Davis - Composer\nDonald Harrison -  Composer, Sax (Alto) \nLorenz Hart - Composer \nJohn Lamkin - Drums \nTed Panken Liner - Notes\nRichard Rodgers - Composer \nFlorian Sommer - Mastering, Mixing \nAya Takemura - Assistant Engineer\n\n\n\n[b]:: Tracks ::[/b]\n01 - Heroes\n02 - Blues For The New Millennium\n03 - My Funny Valentine\n04 - One Of A Kind\n05 - Double Trouble\n06 - Receipt Please\n07 - Candlelight\n08 - Solar\n09 - Free Style\n10 - Iko Iko\n11 - Straight No Chaser\n\n\n\n[b]:: Ripping Details ::[/b]\nExtraction: EAC V0.99 prebeta 4\nCompression: FLAC\nCovers: Yes, @300 dpi\nIncluded: M3U, LOG, CUE.\nOther features: Properly tagged, Accuraterip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1365699e193d4fc2157e6ca8e97d6ac7baccf73","amp;dn":"Donald+Harrison+-+Heroes+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%7BNH+2041%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1365699e193d4fc2157e6ca8e97d6ac7baccf73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,54,86,153,225,147,212,252,33,87,230,202,142,151,214,172,123,172,207,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
