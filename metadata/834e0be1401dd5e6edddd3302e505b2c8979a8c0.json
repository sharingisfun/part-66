Pat considers the proposal and accepts, amidst her son Lance (Thomas Dekker) moving to New York City. PatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband Bill (Tim Robbins) travels often away on business, leaving his wife alone to care for their five children. The crew (Patrick Fugit, Shanna Collins) moves in with the Louds and begins to document them. Relations between Pat and Bill grow frayed due to his time away and the stress of the TV showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production. Craig tells Pat of his suspicions surrounding BillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trips away, giving fairly strong evidence that he is cheating on her. The crew fights with Gilbert about his documentary technique, as he makes them film many personal moments. After surreptitiously duplicating the keys to BillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office, Pat makes a late night trip to the office and discovers documents that confirm he is cheating on Pat with two other women, resulting in PatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preparations to file for a divorce. Angry, she tells Gilbert to have cameras there when she tells Bill, wanting Ã¢â‚¬Å“his bimbos to see it, the whole world to see it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Against her wishes, he films PatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conversation with her brother and his wife.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 6.6/10 from 1,030 users\nDirected by: Shari Springer Berman, Robert Pulcini\nStarring: Diane Lane, Tim Robbins and Thomas Dekker\n\nRelease Name: Cinema.Verite.2011.DVDRip.XviD-BeStDivX\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: XviD, 608Ãƒâ€”336, 945 kbps\nAudio: English, MP3 , 128 Kbps \n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:834e0be1401dd5e6edddd3302e505b2c8979a8c0","amp;dn":"Cinema+Verite+2011+DVDRip+XviD-BeStDivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"834e0be1401dd5e6edddd3302e505b2c8979a8c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,78,11,225,64,29,213,230,237,221,211,48,46,80,91,44,137,121,168,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
