Grogan wakes and is briefly tortured by a Nazi, Colonel Meyer (Matthew Sunderland), who wants to know his mission. During the interrogation, a woman is heard screaming from another room. Grogan eventually escapes and chases Meyer into the tunnels, shooting and injuring him. Grogan follows the sound of the woman up to a room covered in occult symbols. He finds a chained woman (Gina Varela), who reveals herself to be his dead wife, Helena. Meyer enters the room and shoots Grogan in the leg, then shoots Helena in the head, apparently killing her. Grogan attacks Meyer, who explains the woman is a demon, summoned up from a book of black magic found on the island. Meyer proves this by offering Helena the leg of a dead German. She comes back to life and changes into the demon as she eats the leg.\n\nCast:\nCraig Hall ... Captain Ben Grogan\nMatthew Sunderland ... Col Klaus Meyer\nGina Varela ...
