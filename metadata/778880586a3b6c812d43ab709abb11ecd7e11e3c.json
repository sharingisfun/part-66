Living statue ones was easy, patch notes form 1.1.04 tells us: &quot;Living Statue Tier level fixed&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ and thats exactly what I have done (+ small rewarded XP correction). What's the deal with colossus (those were corrected in 1.1.05 btw) Ã¢â‚¬â€ beats me, so if somebody have official game patched to the last ver, he can just seed these files to all of us ;)\n\nand yeah, I know 1.1.07 was released today Ã¢â‚¬â€ just couldn't find it available 4 download anywhere O_o.\n\npeace brothers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778880586a3b6c812d43ab709abb11ecd7e11e3c","amp;dn":"King+Arthur+2+upade+to+1.1.06+fix+only","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778880586a3b6c812d43ab709abb11ecd7e11e3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,136,128,88,106,59,108,129,45,67,171,112,154,187,17,236,215,225,30,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
