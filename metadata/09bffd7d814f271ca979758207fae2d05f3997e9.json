Complex | s01e03 | WEB-DL | Who You Know\n\n\nThis episode was shown on Much Music on 24 January 2012 in Canada and 8 May 2012 on The CW in the USA. \n\n\nABOUT THE SERIES\nFrom the producers of Degrassi comes a new series full of new relationships, salacious temptations, and make-it-or-break it decisions. The L.A. Complex' coming-of-age dwellers grapple with life's defining moments as they deal with the unreality of the show-biz industry.\n\n\nIN THIS EPISODE\nAfter being told that her Hollywood stock has plummeted, Raquel is dumped by her agency. Offended and angry, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even more hell-bent on getting her script optioned, even if it calls for some serious manipulation. Nick, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s failing wildly on the comedy circuit, draws on a bizarre one-night-stand to finally get a laugh. Things are looking up for Tariq when he lays down a killer track, but when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quickly shot down, Tariq wonders if Kaldrick might have it out for him. Meanwhile, Connor should be on top of the world, but he finds himself feeling sad and lonely in a big empty house, and Alicia receives a proposition that could boost her career. Finally, Abby, who has yet to receive her big break, finds herself dangerously close to having to give up her dreams and leave LA. \n\nStefan Brogren, aka  Archie &quot;Snake&quot; Simpson from Degrassi, directed this episode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09bffd7d814f271ca979758207fae2d05f3997e9","amp;dn":"The.LA.Complex.S01E03.Who.You.Know.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-ECI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09bffd7d814f271ca979758207fae2d05f3997e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,191,253,125,129,79,39,28,169,121,117,130,7,250,226,208,95,57,151,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
