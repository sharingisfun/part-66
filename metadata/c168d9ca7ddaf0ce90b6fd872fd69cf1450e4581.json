Every Thursday night, the original gossip girl will have a whole hour to deflate the egos of everyone who is anyone and those who think they're someone. &quot;Kathy&quot; will showcase Griffin's unique take on celebrities, co-workers, friends, politicians, and yes, even her own boxed-wine swilling mother, Maggie. She'll be burning the last of her already very few bridges all while enforcing a clothing optional work environment.
