Ã¢â‚¬Å“The have less than a 1% chance. With a 1-3 from the away leg, any normal conclusion indicates that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible for Bayer 04 Leverkusen to mount a comeback,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Frank Lussem, journalist for the magazine Kicker. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A lot of things can happen in football, the objective is to get a good result, the game should serve the Club to gain recognition, reputation and prestige,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said BildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Phillip Arens.\n\nThe second half of the away leg, the path to follow \n\nDespite what the German press is saying, the fact that Robin DuttÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team have won three consecutive matches allows for a glimmer of hope. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ever since the second half against BarÃƒÂ§a, the team has worked and they beat Augsburg, Cologne and Bayern Munich. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three consecutive wins for the first time this year. Bayer 04 was courageous in the second half against BarÃƒÂ§a. Having courage against teams like Valencia or Chelsea could be enough, but 9 out of 10 times against BarÃƒÂ§a it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Lussem. \n\nHolger Dahl, from the German television channel WDR, said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bayer 04 was very passive in the first half against BarÃƒÂ§a, they committed a lot of errors in their buildup. The hope is that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be more risky at the Camp Nou, like in the second half. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when they gave BarÃƒÂ§a troubles.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGreat respect for BarÃƒÂ§a\n\nThe three journalists agree that Bayer 04 Leverkusen will not play defensively at the Camp Nou. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot of respect, even more so with BarÃƒÂ§a, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hide,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Lussem. Dahl praised GuardiolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BarÃƒÂ§a: Ã¢â‚¬Å“every team that goes up against BarÃƒÂ§a thinks theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re playing against the future European champion. In Germany, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re surprised with the point difference in La Liga, because the perception is that BarÃƒÂ§a is the best team in the world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Arens said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a better team in the world. For Bayer 04 Leverkusen itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a game to learn, to play without fear. If they are afraid, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll sink at the Camp Nou.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nResolution: 1920 x 1080\nAudio: Stereo.
