The first members were Carlos Santana (lead guitar), Tom Fraser (lead vocals &amp; rhythm guitar), Mike Carabello (percussion), Rod Harper (drums), David Brown (bass guitar) and Gregg Rolie (organ). Its breakthrough began two years later, playing in the Woodstock Festival.\nOver a career spanning forty years, Santana exemplified Latin rock, while diversifying into other genres.\nIn 1999 the band released the extremely successful Supernatural, which reached number one in several countries.\nSantana has sold over 100 million records and in 1998 was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.santana.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.santana.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santana_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santana_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n[from Wikipedia]\n\nCheck the INFO file for more details about this torrent\nand....\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE ROLLING STONES\nThe Miss Universe pageant is fixed.
