Dont want to spend a half or a full day downloading at low speed from Nexus mods and unpacking it? Scaring that you will make a mistake and Skyrim will get a nice crash, glitched testures or invisible floor so you will be falling 99999 years straight to the hell?\nI made a job for you. But! You have to make a little bit as well.\nThis is unpacked mod collection from STEP at Nexus (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11). All i did is downloaded mods and unpacked them by following that guide.\nWhat you have to do? Follow the guide:\n1) Follow the guide &quot;STEP Guide (PDF).pdf&quot; (inside the directory) STEP 1.\n2) Copy/paste to your fresh installed Skyrim directory with latest patch 1.4 and HD textures DLC.\n3) Install Nexus Mod Manager (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/content/modmanager/) or inside the directory and register on\n4) Install &quot;NMM MODS&quot; by NMM. Follow the guide!!!\n5) Install &quot;INTERFACE MODS&quot;. Follow the guide!!!\n6) Optional- install &quot;OPTIONAL MODS&quot; if you want.\nThat's it. Now Skyrim becomes awesome.\n\nBest regards\nTher123","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e21c2bc248b595b5e0eed022ef9b9c5ea49e3b55","amp;dn":"Skyrim+STEP+mods+pack.+5%2C5gb+of+unpacked+mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e21c2bc248b595b5e0eed022ef9b9c5ea49e3b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,28,43,194,72,181,149,181,224,238,208,34,239,155,156,94,164,158,59,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
