I saw it 15 years ago and in the last years couldn't remember it any more, name or anything else, just it was about a Romanian country man played superbly by Anthony Quinn. The impression I got from this drama will be eternal. Finally I found the name of the movie, I hope I will be able to buy it. And honestly this movie worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was quite young when I first saw the movie. I asked my friends if they heard about this story but nobody would know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him he was a good &quot;breed&quot; but in fact the German was cheating on him. For few bucks you won't get rich in case you buy the movie but you will be rich if you have it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f637b7a9b5c582e3aba874c8d5afdd83c9e9ada0","amp;dn":"The+25th+Hour+1967+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f637b7a9b5c582e3aba874c8d5afdd83c9e9ada0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,55,183,169,181,197,130,227,171,168,116,200,213,175,221,131,201,233,173,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
