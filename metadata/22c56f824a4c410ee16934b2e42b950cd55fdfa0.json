While this is pretty much the gist of Alejandro FernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez AlmendrasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film, an unusual structure and some acute observations make this exercise in rural realism an involving, quietly rewarding experience. A labour of love in the best sense, the downbeat but accessible Huacho should overcome its obvious commercial limitations to intrigue some specialist art-house buyers, although it will find its truest audience on the festival circuit. \nWinner of the Golden Bear in 2007 for his similarly crafted short, &quot;Along Came the Rain,&quot; Fernandez Almendras portrays a world in which even the smallest events can carry great weight for those barely scraping by. His minimalist script blends with docu-style direction that reveals the minor beauties of the rural setting, as well as the darker plight of peasants trying to survive in a ruthless market economy.\n\n:: Technical Info ::\nVideo Format: Pal\nDVD Source: DVD9\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Format: Dolby Stereo\nAudio: Spanish 5.1, Spanish 2.0\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, French\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c56f824a4c410ee16934b2e42b950cd55fdfa0","amp;dn":"Huacho+%282009%29+DVD9+%2F+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c56f824a4c410ee16934b2e42b950cd55fdfa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,197,111,130,74,76,65,14,225,105,52,178,228,43,149,12,213,95,223,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
