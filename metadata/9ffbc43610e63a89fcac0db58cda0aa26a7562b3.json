Truth to tell, however, there is no Mrs. Holliday: it's the guise assumed by idealistic missionary Ruth (Durbin) to sneak a group of Chinese war orphans into the US. With the help of ship's steward Timothy (Barry Fitzgerald), Ruth poses as the wife of a wealthy shipping magnate who was lost at sea. This enables her to safely sequester the orphans in the Holliday family mansion until she can cook up her next scheme. But things begin to unravel when Ruth falls in love with her &quot;husband&quot;'s grandson (Edmond O'Brien)-and, of course, when Mr. Holliday (Harry Davenport) himself turns up alive and well. The Amazing Mrs. Holliday was originally intended as Durbin's dramatic debut, and originally directed by Jean Renoir, but Universal insisted upon retakes and added songs. Though virtually all of Renoir's completed footage was retained, final directorial credit was bestowed upon Bruce Manning, the film's producer.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035631/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035631/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 480x352\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1065 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,26 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 115 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ffbc43610e63a89fcac0db58cda0aa26a7562b3","amp;dn":"The+Amazing+Mrs+Holliday++1943%29+Deanna+Durbin+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ffbc43610e63a89fcac0db58cda0aa26a7562b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,251,196,54,16,230,58,137,252,172,13,181,140,218,10,162,106,117,98,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
