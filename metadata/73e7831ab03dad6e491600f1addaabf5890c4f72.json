The supposed resort is, in fact, a dark and dreary place inhabited by a demon hound. Angela Blanc, Henry's servant, warns Ciel and Sebastian to leave the resort at once, only for them to witness a death caused by the demon hound. Finnian intervenes when a bad dog is sentenced to punishment, forcing him along with Bardroy, Mey-rin and Tanaka to be tied to a post, while Ciel is chained to a wall. Sebastian unveils that Henry used a silhouetted projection of a dog's face and thereby proves his guiltiness.
