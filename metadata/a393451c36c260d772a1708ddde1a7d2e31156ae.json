Ignoring the warnings of more experienced aide workers, Sam breaks ground for an orphanage where itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most needed-in the middle of territory controlled by the brutal LordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Resistance Army (LRA), a renegade militia that forces youngsters to become soldiers before they even reach their teens. But for Sam, it is not enough to shelter the LRAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intended victims. Determined to save as many as possible, he leads armed missions deep into enemy territory to retrieve kidnapped children, restoring peace to their lives-and eventually his own.\n\nGenre: Action | Biography | Crime\nIMDB Rating: 6.5/10 from 1,990 users\nDirected by: Marc Forster\nStarring: Gerard Butler, Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon\n\nRelease Name: Machine.Gun.Preacher.2011.DVDRip.XviD-Cinemagic\nSize: 1.42GB\nVideo: XviD, 720 x 576, 1643 Kbps\nAudio: English, MP3, 128kbps\nRuntime: 2h 3mn 33s \n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a393451c36c260d772a1708ddde1a7d2e31156ae","amp;dn":"Machine.Gun.Preacher.2011.Dvdrip.xvid.Cinemagic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a393451c36c260d772a1708ddde1a7d2e31156ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,147,69,28,54,194,96,215,114,161,112,141,221,225,167,210,227,17,86,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
