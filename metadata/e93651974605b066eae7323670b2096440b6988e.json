Directed by Simon West, it is a remake of the 1972 film of the same name, directed by Michael Winner and starring Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent. Statham stars as Arthur Bishop, a professional assassin who specializes in making his hits look like accidents, suicides or the acts of petty criminals.[2] It was released in the United States and Canada on January 28, 2011.\n\n\nPlot/Story: \n\nArthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a 'mechanic' - an elite assassin with a strict code and unique talent for cleanly eliminating targets. It's a job that requires professional perfection and total detachment, and Bishop is the best in the business. But when his mentor and close friend Harry (Donald Sutherland) is murdered, Bishop is anything but detached. His next assignment is self-imposed - he wants those responsible dead. His mission grows complicated when Harry's son Steve (Ben Foster) approaches him with the same vengeful goal and a determination to learn Bishop's trade. Bishop has always acted alone but he can't turn his back on Harry's son. A methodical hit man takes an impulsive student deep into his world and a deadly partnership is born. But while in pursuit of their ultimate mark, deceptions threaten to surface and those hired to fix problems become problems themselves. \n\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472399/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472399/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n..............................................................................................................MmMmMmMmMmMmMmM....................................\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Codec: mp4v\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 400\n\nData Rate: 1761\n\nTotal Bitrate: 1889\n \nFrame Rate: 25fps\n\n\n\nAudio Codec: mpga\n\nChannels: Stereo\n\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\n\nBit Rate: 128kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93651974605b066eae7323670b2096440b6988e","amp;dn":"The.Mechanic.DVDRip-720x400.Immagical-2011.mp4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93651974605b066eae7323670b2096440b6988e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,54,81,151,70,5,176,102,234,231,50,54,112,178,9,100,64,182,152,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
