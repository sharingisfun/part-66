In this case it's funeral marches. The producers of these collections have assembled music from all over the globe to illustrate the various ways in which these processionals are carried out. But this isn't entirely done with academic seriousness. There is a sense of humor in everything that Trikont does and that is evident here as well.\n\nThis is what the Trikont folks do so well: They compile records that are seemingly at odds with each other - or questionable in the first place - but turn out to be wondrously artful and accessible documents that provide as much pleasure as they do education. The only drawback is that in their handsome packages,at least on this set, all the liner notes are in German without translation.
