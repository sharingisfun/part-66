Hope some tech guys can have a look at it and post their findings below.\n\n\nfile name: OKR7(Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©â€Â®Ã¦ï¿½Â¢Ã¥Â¤ï¿½7.0Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã§â€°Ë†).iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a7763e8b9b70dc0a50f5ae37a680429b39fc7d6","amp;dn":"Onekey+Recovery+7.0+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a7763e8b9b70dc0a50f5ae37a680429b39fc7d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,119,99,232,185,183,13,192,165,15,90,227,122,104,4,41,179,159,199,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
