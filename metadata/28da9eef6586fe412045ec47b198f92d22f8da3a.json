He also states that he would break the leg if any don steps in Mumbai.\nInstantly Surya (Mahesh Babu) steps in Mumbai. His friend (Brahmaji) takes him to his room in slum. Surya asks him to quit job and join him as an assistant to do his proposed crime business. He also says that he is in Mumbai to make it piss.\nHow he emerges as a don falls rest of the story. He uses his brain and brawn to grow big in Mumbai. He plays with system and preys on politicians to grow his business.\nOn parallel line he loves Chitra (Kajal), the daughter of commissioner.\nStory wise, it's simple but the narration beauty is ample and dialogues tremble the senses of audience.
