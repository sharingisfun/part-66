A visit from his only living relative reveals the truth. Nick has inherited the ability to see supernatural creatures, and as a &quot;Grimm,&quot; he is tasked with keeping the balance between mankind and the mythological. A reformed &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot; becomes his greatest (and also reluctant) ally and confidant. It's not long before his work as a policeman leads Nick to the criminals he once thought were only found in fairy tales","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e52ba2a273b58636fdc574b0d71927936c366ad","amp;dn":"Grimm.S01E13.SWESUB.HDTV.XviD-snuttebullen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e52ba2a273b58636fdc574b0d71927936c366ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,82,186,42,39,59,88,99,111,220,87,75,13,113,146,121,54,195,102,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
