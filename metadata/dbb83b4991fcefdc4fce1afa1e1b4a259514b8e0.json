It will be made into somewhat like a memoir or maybe not, I have not decided and truthfully I will make up everything as I go on and on. The name though comes from the fact of Zombies, wanting brains and when I thought of brains I thought of that. Though the name may change to something way better as the story comes along. I would bore you with a long list of people I would like to thank but I won't do that, I just want to cut to the chase and that my reader will begin as soon as the next sun rises. i have my favorite zombie bracelet on and a mind full of zombie knowledge and gaming that will help me shape these zombies into what I want them to be and later on I will post sketches of what they look like, but for now I will play my role as the main character in the story because it is easier for me to write in first person than in third, and it gives you a realistic point of view. I bid you all a farewell as I grab my shotgun and brigade all my windows and doors, because Zombies are everywhere around me...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb83b4991fcefdc4fce1afa1e1b4a259514b8e0","amp;dn":"Cerebral+Cortex","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb83b4991fcefdc4fce1afa1e1b4a259514b8e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,184,59,73,145,252,239,220,79,206,26,250,30,27,74,37,149,20,184,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
