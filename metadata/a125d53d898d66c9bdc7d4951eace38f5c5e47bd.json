Drummer Tony\nMorra puts his heart and soul into this collection. It must be experienced\nto be believed!\n\n&quot;Each multitrack loop is split into tracks that can be mixed at will. You\nget mono Kick, Snare, and Hat tracks, and stereo Toms, Overheads, Room\nBig Room, and &quot;Gak&quot; tracks. Besides verses, choruses, fills, bridges\nintros, and endings, each song has Punctuation Mark loops, which consist\nof bass-drum and cymbal accents. Some songs have Crash and Burn endings in\nwhich Morra fills wildly. All have Bash tracks, in which he keeps time but\nhits cymbals on all the downbeats. Including drum solos in a loop library\nwas a novel idea. You get three solos: two that are less than 30 seconds\nlong, and a third lasts for more than two minutes. Morra blazes through\nthem...the solos have lots of cool parts that could be cut up and used for\nfills or in other short sections.&quot; From EM's Discrete Drums Heavy Mental\nDrums Review\nHeavy Mental Pro Set Contains\n14 CDs filled with 24 bit WAV files plus 2 audio CDs for easy auditioning\n\n13 drum tracks - kick, snare, hat, stereo toms, stereo overheads, stereo\nclose room, stereo big room and stereo &quot;gak&quot;\n\nThe library includes 16 projects, each with an average of 72 song segments\nranging from simple rock to flailing double kick madness, 3 drum solos\nmiscellaneous bits, 1151 song segments - Almost 9 GB!\n\nI N S T A L L A T I O N\n\n1.
