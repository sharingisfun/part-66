Jay released his critically lauded debut album goddamned in 2008, but first gained attention with his role in John Cameron MitchellÃƒâ€ s 2006 indie film Shortbus, where he performed his original song, Soda Shop.\n\nFor his sophomore effort, Jay teams up with Grammy-winning producer David Kahne (Regina Spektor, Paul McCartney, The Bangles), who brings instrumental textures to JayÃƒâ€ s songwriting, hinting at a slightly new direction for the minimalist artist while maintaining the signature qualities of a Jay Brannan album: brutal honesty, sharp wit, and sparkling melodies. Lyrically, the album follows the singer through states of loneliness, anger, rejection, and yearning, while somehow offering a glimpse of hope and self-acceptance.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
