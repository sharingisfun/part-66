Joined by new\ninvestigators Jesslyn and Jason, John and the team visit Charlet Sosh in Warsaw, Kentucky.\nSince moving into their spacious 200-year-old mansion, the oldest standing house along the\nOhio River, Charlet and her son, Ryne, say they have been experiencing frightening phenomena.\nThey report witnessing shadows(caught on amateur video), feeling blankets being pulled down\non them, and seeing the bedroom door swing open on its own. The property dates back to\nNative American times, and many items like arrowheads, pottery and even a bone have been\nunearthed in the backyard. Could some dark history be connected to one of these objects,\ncausing the activity thats scaring Charlet and her son?\n\nAfter the eerie Kentucky investigation, the team travels to Huron, Ohio to help out Lisa Kelly,\nowner of a demolition company thats scheduled to implode an abandoned grain mill. Workers at\nthe building have been walking off the project, terrified by apparitions, screams, and equipment\ninexplicably being shifted around. With demolition of the towering facility set in just two days,\nJohn and his team have to act fast to determine whether there is merit to the claims, and if so\nto remove any haunted items before the place is blown to bits.\n\n\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 433MB\nDuration : 42mn 58s\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 1 169 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8f6fc0900e2a828c211d21820fa323410ef88df","amp;dn":"Haunted+Collector+S02E01+Haunted+Mansion+Ghost+Mill+HDTV+XviD-AF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8f6fc0900e2a828c211d21820fa323410ef88df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,246,252,9,0,226,168,40,194,17,210,24,32,250,50,52,16,239,136,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
