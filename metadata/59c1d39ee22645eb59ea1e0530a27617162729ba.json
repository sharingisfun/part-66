There is truth here for all ages and beliefs\n\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Evolution of a Creationist is an exciting, entertaining and challenging lecture series by Dr. Jobe Martin, presenting key ideas and concepts from his book of the same name. Dr. Martin discusses some of the Incredible Creatures that Defy Evolution as well as the many facts and findings in our world and our universe that evolutionists are unable to explain.\n\nThis four-part lecture is presented in front of a live audience, with photos, charts and video clips interspersed to aid in understanding. A 70-page workbook accompanies each video set, with fill-in-the-blank questions to stimulate discussion and comprehension. You can make your own copies of the workbook or purchase additional copies separately. Each part of the lecture is approximately one hour long, making the series perfect for Sunday School classes, Sunday evening services, Home Bible Studies, home schooling and small group meetings.\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\n\nJESUS:[/size] Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\n Confirmed Sighting - Jesus Lives - coming 7-4-11.[/size]\n\n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&lt;/a&gt;             A place where Jesus would feel at home.
