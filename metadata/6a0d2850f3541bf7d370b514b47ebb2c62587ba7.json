Somehow we used the wrong audio track which caused the release to go OOS. \n We're blaming that skunk weed and the sheer awfulness of this show.\n\n Everything else we said about quality/settings still apply. Now enjoy this horrible\n show in real non fuzzy 720 quality and with the audio in sync.\n\n\n\n ----\n\n\n\n TWG's release has had it's headers stripped which is prohibited by the 720\n rule set. While we appreciate you finally adhearing to the LocalNet's source proof\n request there are still questions as to why your releases are consistantly smaller\n and fuzzier then ours using the same CRF value and settings. \n\n Included in the sample folder are cuts that show just how fuzzy and lacking in detail\n TWG's encodes are. Notice the differences in the texture of the background and the details\n in the faces of the actors. The colors also look to be off.\n\n We tried encoding this episode multiple times with multiple settings and none of them \n hit anywhere near the size of the TWG pre. While there may be some differences due to\n source providers and different affiliates there shouldn't be such a vast difference. Take\n that for what's it worth. We hate to see Canadian TV suffer encode wise like it's American\n big brother. We'll continue to pursue this until a time when it's fixed. Happy Valetines Day \n you potheads.\n\n\n\n            Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?\n                          &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a2c6cdd1c7d3d7cbd1e2c1d0dbd2d6cdcfc3cbce8ccdd0c5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n                            \n                                                          \n                                                   \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                         \n                                                   \n                          \n                                       \n                                                   \n                                     \n                             \n                         \n                  \n               RESPECT TO        \n        \n       \n       \n         FQM       \n   \n        \n                  2x    \n                        SunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a0d2850f3541bf7d370b514b47ebb2c62587ba7","amp;dn":"Little.Mosque.on.the.Prairie.S06E06.PROPER.REPACK.720p.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a0d2850f3541bf7d370b514b47ebb2c62587ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,13,40,80,243,84,27,247,211,112,181,20,180,126,187,44,98,88,123,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
