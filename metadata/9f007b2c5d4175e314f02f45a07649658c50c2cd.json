The introduction of the City Security Act has caused the creation of the Enforcers, licensed vigilantes who take to the streets in an effort to stop the Criminals where the Cops couldn't. The Enforcer faction believes that it is a force for good; the Criminal faction believes that its city and freedom are under threat.\n\nBut who has the right of it: Criminal or Enforcer?\n\nYour decision is to choose which of these two factions has your allegiance. In a fast paced PvP action game, you must fight for the survival of your chosen faction, gaining standing with several organisations along the way. In doing so, these organisations will provide you with new and exotic weapons, vehicles, and clothing that will not only change the way you play but will affect how cool you look and sound when doing it.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nKey Features:\nTake to the City as either an Enforcer or Criminal in a persistent world.\nHigh Octane PvP combat in a massive living city.\nUnparalleled Customisation of Player, Clothing and Vehicle.\n27 Unique Vehicles ranging from SUVs to Performance Vehicles.\nOver 30 unique weapons, fully customisable with a raft of modifications.\nHundreds of clothing items and symbols that will make your character completely unique.\nA deep, custom music studio in which to create your own themes.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSystem Requirements\nMinimum:\n\nOS:Windows XP\nProcessor:Intel Core 2 Duo E6420 (2.13GHz) or AMD Athlon x2 5800+ (3.0GHz)\nMemory:3 GB RAM\nGraphics:GeForce 7800 with 256MB and support for Pixel Shader 3.0, or AMD equivalent\nDirectXÃ‚Â®:dx90c\nHard Drive:7 GB HD space\nOther Requirements:Broadband Internet connection\nRecommended:\n\nOS:Windows Vista 64-Bit / Windows 7 64-Bit\nProcessor:2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Quad or equivalent AMD x4\nMemory:4 GB RAM\nGraphics:GeForce 8800GT 512MB or AMD equivalent\nDirectXÃ‚Â®:dx90c\nHard Drive:7 GB HD space\nSound:Dedicated sound card with hardware acceleration.\nOther Requirements:Broadband Internet connection\n===================================================================================\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstructions for install: No need to install , just download , unrar and start the game from Launcher/APB Launcher.exe\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy to download this over other torrent/direct downloads?: Because I've ripped all the audio inside the folder, which was hell lot of it, to a great extent and the result making the folder a lot small... and thus saving your time+bandwidth :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f007b2c5d4175e314f02f45a07649658c50c2cd","amp;dn":"APB+Reloaded+fully+ripped+by+iFarted%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f007b2c5d4175e314f02f45a07649658c50c2cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,0,123,44,93,65,117,227,20,240,47,69,160,118,73,101,140,80,194,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
