Just download, unzip using the windows default program or any other program you have and then run the installer. No patches or mods, it's the original demo I just uploaded since I didn't found one on tpb. It works correctly on any windows, I currently use it on windows 7 x64bit. Enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84635e19c059e6dae8ddf467a6bd82c384ba0956","amp;dn":"Unreal+Tournament+2004+Demo+UT2K4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84635e19c059e6dae8ddf467a6bd82c384ba0956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,99,94,25,192,89,230,218,232,221,244,103,166,189,130,195,132,186,9,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
