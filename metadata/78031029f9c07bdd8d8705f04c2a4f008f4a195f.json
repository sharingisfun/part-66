Yet there was a time, and not all that long ago, when Buddy Guy couldn't even negotiate a decent record deal. Times sure have changed for the better: Guy's first three albums for Silvertone in the '90s all earned Grammys. Eric Clapton unabashedly calls Guy his favorite blues axeman, and so do a great many adoring fans worldwide.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Buddys Blues (Part 1)  4:13\n2 IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Got A Right to Love My Woman 8:05\n3 Done Got Over You 4:10\n4 Tell Me WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Inside of You  9:20\n5 Trouble With My Woman 4:05\n6  The Things I Used to Do 3:18\n7 You DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Know How I Feel  3:12\n8 The Dollar Done Fell 16:22\n9 Buddys Blues (Part 2)  3:25\n\nPersonell:\n\nBuddy Guy vocals, guitar\nPhil Guy   guitar\nLittle Phil Smith guitar\nJ W Williams bass\nRay Allison drums\n\nRecorded live at Buddy Guy's Checkerboard Lounge\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78031029f9c07bdd8d8705f04c2a4f008f4a195f","amp;dn":"Buddy+Guy+The+Dollar+Done+Fell+%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78031029f9c07bdd8d8705f04c2a4f008f4a195f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,3,16,41,249,192,123,221,141,135,5,240,76,42,79,0,143,74,25,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
