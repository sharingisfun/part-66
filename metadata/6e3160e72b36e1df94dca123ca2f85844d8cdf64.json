The news is flashed over television and overnight, an insignificant junior doctor receives international recognition. Professional jealousy and abuse of power threaten Dr. Roy, even as the Secretary of Health reprimands him for breaking the news to the press. He is asked to report to the Director of Health. Professional colleagues Dr. Arijit Sen and Dr. Ramananda invite him to a lecture but it is merely a pretence to humiliate him. Dr. Roy suffers a mild heart attack but he refuses to go to the hospital. His wife (Shabana Azmi) and a few others like Dr. Kundu and Amulya (Irfan Khan) stand by Dr. Roy, but the harassment continues; a letter from a British foundation, John Anderson Foundation, is suppressed and Dr. Roy transferred to a remote village. The last straw is two American doctors receiving credit for discovering the same vaccine. Dr. Roy is shattered.\n\nAwards :\n38th National Film Awards, India\n1991 National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film\n1991 National Film Award for Best Directing: Tapan Sinha\n1991 National Film Award - Special Jury Award: Pankaj Kapoor (Dr. Dipankar Roy).\n\nBengal Film Journalists' Association Awards\n1991 Best Film\n1991 Best Director\n\nFilmfare Awards\n1992 Filmfare Best Screenplay Award: Tapan Sinha.\n\nCast:\nPankaj Kapoor...Dr.Dipankar Roy\nShabana Azmi...Seema (Dr.Roy's Wife)\nIrfan Khan...Amulya the Journalist\nVijayendra Ghatge...Dr.Arijit(Dr.Roy's childhood friend)\nDeepa Sahi...Paromita(Vijayendra Ghatge's Wife)\n\nMedia Info:\nLanguage - Hindi (Indian)\nVideo Size - 1.07 GB\nVideo Codec - MPEG-4\nVideo Res - 426 x 316\nVideo Frame Rate - 25 fps \nVideo Bitrate - 1147 Kbps\nVideo Container - Matroska Video\nSubtitles - English Hardcoded\nAudio Codec - AAC\nChannels - Stereo\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength -  2 Hrs 13 mins\n\nScreenshots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3160e72b36e1df94dca123ca2f85844d8cdf64","amp;dn":"Ek+Doctor+Ki+Maut+%7E+1991+%7E+DVD+Rip+%7E+1.06GB+%7E+Phantom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e3160e72b36e1df94dca123ca2f85844d8cdf64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,49,96,231,43,54,225,223,148,220,161,35,202,47,133,132,77,140,223,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
