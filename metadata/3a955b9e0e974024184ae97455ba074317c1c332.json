They were originally best known for minor contributions to early fictional narrative film and Boer War dramatisation films, but the discovery in 1994 of a hoard of film negatives led to restoration of the Mitchell &amp; Kenyon Collection, the largest surviving collection of early non-fiction actuality films in the world. This collection provides a fresh view of Edwardian England and an important resource for historians.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a955b9e0e974024184ae97455ba074317c1c332","amp;dn":"Mitchell+and+Kenyon+-+Electric+Edwardians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a955b9e0e974024184ae97455ba074317c1c332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,149,91,158,14,151,64,36,24,74,233,116,85,186,7,67,23,193,195,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
