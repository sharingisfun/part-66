Now for the first time, crocs have become the biggest killers of humans in Africa - up to 700 this year - so new research is vital. \n\nWildlife experts Brad Bestelink and Andy Crawford have devised a method of diving with crocodiles which they believe to be safe. For the first time, leading crocodile authority Adam Britton has come to test their theories, and see if they can reveal new information about these magnificent beasts. But after the team's underwater cameraman Mike Pitts has a near miss with a crocodile, will they continue with the task they have set themselves? \n\n\n\n\nSwimming With Crocodiles - S01 - E01 - Botswana\nSwimming With Crocodiles - S01 - E02 - Australia\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n\n\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 58mn 4s\nBit rate                                 : 1 563 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 672 pixels\nHeight                                   : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.242\nStream size                              : 649 MiB (93%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 58mn 4s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 110 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96044d2b5164aae2cfc8ed0e13a61d9f488d8e1a","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Swimming+With+Crocodiles+-+S01+-+TVrip+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96044d2b5164aae2cfc8ed0e13a61d9f488d8e1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,4,77,43,81,100,170,226,207,200,237,14,19,166,29,159,72,141,142,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
