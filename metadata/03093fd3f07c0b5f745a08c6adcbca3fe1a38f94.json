Traveling with her is her team of bodyguards who are mostly composed of ex-military veterans. \n\nHer latest addition to her crew is Jonah, a seemingly emotionless child soldier who is skilled in combat yet ironically hates arms dealers. Jonah joins Koko as he wishes to find the arms dealer responsible for his family's death. \n\nWhat follows is Koko and her crews escapades around the world. \n\n\n\n\nRelease date       : April 11, 2012\n\n\nAudio language     : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language  : English\n\n\nGenres             : Action, Adventure, Seinen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03093fd3f07c0b5f745a08c6adcbca3fe1a38f94","amp;dn":"%5BNemDiggers%5D+Jormungand+-+01+%5B720p%5D+%5BH264+AAC+MP4%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03093fd3f07c0b5f745a08c6adcbca3fe1a38f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,9,63,211,240,124,11,95,116,90,8,198,173,203,202,63,225,163,143,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
