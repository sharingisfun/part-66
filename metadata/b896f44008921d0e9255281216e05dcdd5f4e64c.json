Now, Ben has to choose between going down the path of Juvi hall or spending the summer in Iowa on a farm with his estranged grandfather, Jack (Peter Fonda). The day after arriving, Ben is ready to leave. To help Ben get a friend, Jack gets him a smart farm dog from an animal shelter to keep Ben company and in line. Between the dog and a friendly neighbor (Louis Gossett, Jr.), Ben soon learns life lessons about friendship, family and responsibility.
