Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in AiaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium.\n\nBut winning is only part of the fun in Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing! Each character has a specific All Star move Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as Super Sonic, Banana Blitz and Tails Tornado Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that allows a quick way for competitors to get back into the race! Power ups and weapons can also be collected around the tracks and used against the opposition to ensure they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a threat to that number one position.\n\nBattle it out in single or multiplayer mode, allowing up to four friends to race in frantic split-screen action, or up to eight players to compete online in the ultimate racing showdown.\n\nCan Amigo scramble Eggman? Will AiAi say bye-bye to Tails? Are you gonna be faster than Sonic? The race will start in 2010Ã¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f49aec427392f77d505fa40384a7bb041a06d70","amp;dn":"Sonic+%26amp%3B+Sega+All-Stars+Racing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f49aec427392f77d505fa40384a7bb041a06d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,73,174,196,39,57,47,119,213,5,250,64,56,74,123,176,65,160,109,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
