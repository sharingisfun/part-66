They consist of the Darkplaces engine and many, many graphical mods from members of the Quake One forums and elsewhere (these are listed at the bottom of the page). If it were not for these brave troopers, Epsilon would not exist. The builds are legal and do not contain any pirated content. Just simple unzip-and-play stuff, no mucking about.\nwww.xpfree.org/epsilon\n\nThere are four tiers of builds, low, medium, high, and ultra.\n\n\nUltra builds - Ultra-high-quality texturing and bump-maps enabled. For excellent machines with excellent graphics cards. 2011-year or upwards graphics card, recent quad-core cpu, 4gb+ ram recommended.\n\nHigh builds - Ultra-high-texturing but no bump-mapping. Half the size &amp; memory usage of the Ultra build. For good machines with good graphics cards. Main difference between this and \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; is there is no support or texturing for bump maps. Geforce 7800 or upwards, dual-core 3ghz &amp; upwards, 2gb ram and upwards recommended.\n\nMedium builds - For medium spec computers and laptops with reasonable onboard 3d chipsets. High-quality texturing, fewer shader effects, no bump-mapping, graphical options optimised for performance. About half the size and memory usage of the \\&quot;High\\&quot; build.\n\nLow builds - Uses the QRP texture pack and the old models, which is less gritty and grimy but more like the original quake, and uses less memory yet again. This is a low-spec build for people with older laptops, graphics cards without shader support, and older machines in general. But it\\'s also for those who want more of a \\&quot;original opengl quake\\&quot; experience, but with slightly more \\&quot;HD\\&quot; texturing.\n\n\nthanks to and sources:\n\nQuake
