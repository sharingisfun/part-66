With modesetting enabled, its performance is barely acceptable and with modesetting off it is only acceptable performance. However, the newer video cards work wonderful with modesetting. If you have any trouble with desktop performance, try booting with the option: nomodeset. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kevux.org/news.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kevux.org/news.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTurtle Kevux - 0.9.5\nFixes of Turtle 0.9.4 Problems\n    * A large number of kiwi installation problems have been fixed.\n    * claws-mail now works.\n    * The mpd music server now dmixes properly by default so you can now have more than one program use audio at the same time.\n    * Fixed applications that did not look for the mixer device in /dev/snd/mixer.\n    * /lib/libudev.so and /lib/libgudev-1.0.so had permissions that prevented desktop users from using any application that depended on either of those libraries.\n    * Copy and paste on the desktop now works in xfce.\n    * 64-bit grub cdroms now boot properly.\n    * Fixed boot problems when using software raid.\nNew Software\n    * Added libffi\n    * Added vcdimager\n    * Added libblueray\n    * Added libaacs\nOther Changes\n    * Now using xorg-server 1.11.* and Mesa 7.11.*.\n    * Fixed webkit so that SoupSession is in the correct state to allow for pausing and unpausing.\n    * The boot process was reworked. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kevux.org/turtle/changelog.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kevux.org/turtle/changelog.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kevux.org/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kevux.org/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kevux.org/turtle/download.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kevux.org/turtle/download.html&lt;/a&gt; (others versions) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kevux.org/turtle/documentation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kevux.org/turtle/documentation.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kevux.org/turtle/plans.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kevux.org/turtle/plans.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freecode.com/projects/kevux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freecode.com/projects/kevux&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha256 : ec202b11149f4c80b9bde6ec8899e03ecb8cafd3cc21d12f37edc30fdb8334ef  turtle-0.9.5-desktop_x86-live.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2afb606bf525bd46efa66f80524fd8ce127c9756","amp;dn":"turtle-0.9.5-desktop_x86-live.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2afb606bf525bd46efa66f80524fd8ce127c9756","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,251,96,107,245,37,189,70,239,166,111,128,82,79,216,206,18,124,151,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
