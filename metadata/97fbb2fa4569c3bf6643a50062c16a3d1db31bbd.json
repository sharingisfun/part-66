In the second half of the show Max talks to filmmakers William Gagan and Geoff Shively about their crowd funded journey to Syria and 'fake' activists and, with the introduction of anti-free speech laws in Chicago, the filmmakers discuss the small drone helicopters they have acquired for reporting on the NATO summit.          \n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
