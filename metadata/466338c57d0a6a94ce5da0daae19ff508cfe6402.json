It belongs to the National Trust.\n\nThe gardens, which are a celebrated example of the Picturesque style, are open to the public. The central feature is the ruins of a medieval, moated manor house, Scotney Old Castle, which is on an island on a small lake. The lake is surrounded by sloping, wooded gardens with fine collections of rhododendrons, azaleas and kalmia for spring colour, summer wisteria and roses, and spectacular autumn colour.\n\n\n\nIf you want to say something to me say via deloungepagina.nl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:466338c57d0a6a94ce5da0daae19ff508cfe6402","amp;dn":"Scotney+Castle+Live+Wallpaper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"466338c57d0a6a94ce5da0daae19ff508cfe6402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,99,56,197,125,10,106,148,206,93,160,218,174,25,255,80,140,254,100,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
