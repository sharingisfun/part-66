But they never reached their destination as a storm brought their plane down in the high Andes, leaving the survivors stranded on a remote glacier. Ill-equipped, with no food and little hope of rescue, the survivors faced extreme hardship and many life-or-death situations, including the agonising decision to eat the flesh of those killed in the crash to stay alive. Thirty years later, those that got down from the mountain relive their 72 days 'up there' to give this extraordinarily powerful, vivid and immediate account of human endurance and heroism.\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : BBC Storyville 2008 Stranded The Andes\n                                   Plane Crash Survivors [PDTV] ZiLLa\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 920 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 50mn\n\nVideo:\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nBit rate                         : 1 159 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\n\nAudio:\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\n\nCheers.
