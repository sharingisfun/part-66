A mad bet which might well impact the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peace.\n \nStarting from a personality profile through exclusive testimonies, this film offers a geopolitical analysis of the Korean peninsula based on first hand Russian, Chinese and Korean archive footage.\n \nThe film casts an indispensable light on an issue which might one day concern us all.\nClearly, that one day has now arrived.
