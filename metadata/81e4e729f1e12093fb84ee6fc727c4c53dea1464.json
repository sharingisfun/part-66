It also includes other freely-available videos referenced in the series, including three from cdk007, a video I made about Piltdown Man, and the clip of students doing a rather stupid protest of evolution.\n\nThis disc is small enough to burn to a standard single-layer DVD-R, and should play fine in any Blu-Ray player.\n\nThere is also a DVD version here: thepiratebay.se/torrent/4797482","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81e4e729f1e12093fb84ee6fc727c4c53dea1464","amp;dn":"How.Evolution.Is.Scientific.Blu-Ray.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81e4e729f1e12093fb84ee6fc727c4c53dea1464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,228,231,41,241,225,32,147,251,132,238,111,199,39,196,197,61,234,20,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
