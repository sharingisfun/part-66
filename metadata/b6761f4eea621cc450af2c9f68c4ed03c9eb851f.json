There is little place for men in their lives so of course, when one of them falls in love, their world is thrown off balance. Everybody tries their best to find a new equilibrium. But fate barely gives them the chance to catch their breath before throwing them into a whole new reality. Once again, the family has to start over.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 7.1/10\nDirected by: MÃƒÂ©lanie Laurent\nWriters: Davina To, Tony Tang\n\nRelease Name: The.Adopted.2011.BDRip.XviD-AEN\nSize: 700MB\nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”304, 832 kbps, 24.000 fps\nAudio: French, MP3, 144 kbit/s\nRuntime: 99 min 37 sec\nSubtitles: English\n\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6761f4eea621cc450af2c9f68c4ed03c9eb851f","amp;dn":"The.Adopted.2011.BDRip.XviD-AEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6761f4eea621cc450af2c9f68c4ed03c9eb851f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,118,31,78,234,98,28,196,80,175,44,159,104,196,237,3,201,235,133,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
