The first part is about\nAnonymous, what they are, what they do, what they've done, and some of the\nrepercussions of their operations.  The main focus of these documentaries is\non Anonymous' actions in Greece but other countries seem to be mentioned.\nA number of information security experts were interviewed (their names are\nunknown but if you really want to know you can zoom in on the credits and read\nthem) along with someone claiming to be Commander X, who was raided and\nsubsequently went on the run.  In the second episode a number of Greek Anons\nwere interviewed about their activities (in Greek, I've no idea what they're\nsaying).  The second episode appears to be more of the same though some\nmembers of Telecomix were also interviewed to give a second viewpoint and to\nprovide information about what took place in Egypt, Tunisia, and Syria.  They\ntalk a little about their actions and why they do what they do.\n\nMuch of the audio is in Greek because it was made by a Greek television\nnetwork.  Most of the interviewees are speaking English and are subtitled in\nGreek (hardcoded).  On-screen captions are in Greek.\n\nFile format: FLV, use VLC to play back.\n\nHomepage: http://www.megatv.com/warzone/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20a72f0f4c77d5c98adc657a2b259255430dbff4","amp;dn":"MegaTV+Warzone%3A+Soldiers+With+No+Name","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20a72f0f4c77d5c98adc657a2b259255430dbff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,167,47,15,76,119,213,201,138,220,101,122,43,37,146,85,67,13,191,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
