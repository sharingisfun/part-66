Put them in a vividly stunning fantasy realm. Then give them an impossible mission - pulling off the biggest heist of all time in the middle of a war. All you have to do is battle your way through dastardly enemies, giant war machines and an army of psychopathic robots. But don't worry; you have plenty of ammo and absolutely no common sense. Victory is yours in 12,000 bullets or less!\n -&gt; Fight your way through 21 action-packed missions.\n-&gt; Brandish over 17 outlandish weapons like the Cyclops Sniper Rifle, the\n Vindaloo Rocket Launcher, or the Topsy-Turvy and Sticky bomb.\n-&gt; Explore five diverse environments including icy and snowy regions, mountains with breathtaking vistas, deep and foreboding woods, and rain-spattered cliffs.\n-&gt; Take down wicked enemies like half-man, half-animal Grunts, eliminator droids, wall-smashing \nGoliaths, evil monks and wild twiglets.\n-&gt; Navigate through a richly entertaining story with two smack-talkin'\n \n******************* FINALLY : If you like the game BUY IT!******************* ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004775f2ac5969501ab3119d0297a1a4f71b7e7c","amp;dn":"Armed+And+Dangerous+Rip+-+TECHNIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004775f2ac5969501ab3119d0297a1a4f71b7e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,71,117,242,172,89,105,80,26,179,17,157,2,151,161,164,247,27,126,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
