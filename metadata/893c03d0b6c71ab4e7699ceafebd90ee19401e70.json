This happens when Tom Chance goes to the same hotel on a blind date to meet a girl (who is also called Alison), that Alison Little has arranged to meet her cousin Tom (for the first time since they were young children).\n\nTom is shy towards Alison. However, Alison has fallen in love with Tom at first sight and she is keen for their friendship to develop into something more intimate.\n\nTom has a tendency to get into trouble as a result of unlikely coincidences. This leads to Tom being arrested for crimes he did not commit Ã¢â‚¬â€ which happens so often that police Sergeant Gough eventually gives orders for Tom not to be arrested, no matter how suspicious the circumstances.\n\nTom has an amusing ability to drink an entire pint of beer in one gulp whilst in the middle of speaking a sentence. (According to Callow in a DVD commentary, a trick glass containing a fraction of a pint was actually used.)\n\nTomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style of speaking is a key component of his comic nature. He speaks only in short staccato sentences similar to a telegram. CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talk Alison. Car being towed. Problem with lawn furnitureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSeed it or LOSE it...just make sure you enjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893c03d0b6c71ab4e7699ceafebd90ee19401e70","amp;dn":"Chance+in+a+Million+-+Series+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893c03d0b6c71ab4e7699ceafebd90ee19401e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,60,3,208,182,199,26,180,231,105,156,234,254,189,144,238,25,64,30,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
