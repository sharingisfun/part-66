The Gunners ran out 5-3 winners at Stamford Bridge back in October with Robin van Persie scoring a hat-trick. At the time Alan Hansen called it - one of the best matches you will ever see - and claimed it could have ended in a 10-10 draw. Can the two sides chasing Champions League qualification for next season serve up another classic?\n\nElsewhere, Tottenham travelled across London to take on QPR while Blackburn played Norwich dreaming of a similar result to their first ever Premier League meeting with the Canaries 20 years ago, when they prevailed 7-1 at Ewood Park.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06dd672aa84c5eac5b7169e494bf1766ea86f9a5","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-++21.04.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06dd672aa84c5eac5b7169e494bf1766ea86f9a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,221,103,42,168,76,94,172,91,113,105,228,148,191,23,102,234,134,249,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
