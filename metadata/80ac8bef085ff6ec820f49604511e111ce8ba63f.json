But standing in his way of matrimonial bliss is IrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ex boyfriend, Chuy (Jon Huertas), a dim witted thug with a speech impediment, who will stop at nothing to foil HectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship. Bigger problems arise when Hector realizes that he has accidentally lost IrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ re-engagement ring.\n\nThe frantic hunt begins. Hector enlists his best friend, Peanut (Aris Alvarado), a 322 pound virgin, in his quest for the ring. The dilemma thickens when Carmen (Erlinda Orozco), HectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood friend who left to college, returns to the neighborhood, only to join the duo, knowing that Iris would not approve. After failed desperate attempts to remedy the situation, despair finally rears its head. Hector suggests a yard sale on a Tuesday afternoon in order to raise money.\n\nBut the yard sale only opens up more doors for more problems as Hector struggles to navigate through them. A romantic complication unfolds as hidden feelings between Hector and Carmen unfurl. Though they both bottle up their affections, Iris senses something. This romantic triangle escalates even more when Chuy and his henchmen unleash this master plan to cripple all of HectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationships and disrupt his yard sale fundraiser.\n\nHectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feeble resistance only ends in disaster. The urgency of his re-engagement party continues to grow more imperative. Misfortune and immense pressure guide Hector to a climatic crossroad where looters, riots, catfights, and The Lord of the Fingers await.\nTHE SOUNDS OF THE YARDSALE\n\nBlazinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Music in the Yardsale...
