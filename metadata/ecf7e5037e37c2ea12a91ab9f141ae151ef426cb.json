Demonstrations of Movimento connected to a 4\nCCD camera capture system will take place at the SIGGRAPH Exhibition\n(REALVIZ booth 419) from Aug 1-3, 2006.\n\nMovimento requires a minimum of 2 cameras upwards, which can be either fixed\nor moving. Any frame rate and/or resolution may also be used. Mocap data\nfrom Movimento can also be exported to Autodesk MotionBuilder, 3ds Max, Maya\nand SOFTIMAGE|XSI for further manipulation. Custom computations and/or\nexports can be realized through scripting (Python, Perl, TCL/TK). REALVIZ\nMovimento offers users an affordable, accurate and highly flexible motion\ncapture solution, without the need for a motion capture studio.\n\nMovimento &quot;Powered By SMART&quot;\nSMART ('Scalable Matching Architecture for Tracking') is a powerful\nautomatic tracking kernel, based on new generation algorithms, which brings\nradical performance increase to the REALVIZ tracking products. This new\ntechnology, which debuted in 2005, provides 2D tracking up to 6 to 10 times\nfaster than previous engines, whilst simultaneously making optimum use of\navailable processing power. SMART also produces much higher quality feature\ntracks than previously, more steady, with a longer lifespan and fewer\ninterruptions and drops. The SMART tracking engine also automatically places\nsignificantly more tracking points on footage, as well as enabling users to\nadjust the tracker quantity factor - for smarter and more reliable solves\nthan ever before.\n\nREALVIZ 'SMART' tracking technology is acknowledged as the 'weapon of\nchoice' for post-production professionals worldwide, and has been used to\ncreate stunning visual effects in many recent major movies, including:\n'Superman Returns', 'V for Vendetta', 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire',\n'Lord of War', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'Sin City', 'Kung Fu\nHustle', 'The Day After Tomorrow', 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow',\n'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' and 'Alien vs. Predator'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf7e5037e37c2ea12a91ab9f141ae151ef426cb","amp;dn":"Realviz+movimento","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf7e5037e37c2ea12a91ab9f141ae151ef426cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,247,229,3,126,55,194,234,18,169,26,185,241,65,174,21,30,244,38,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
