Iraq war veteran Walter Sherman (Geoff Stults) gained a reputation in his army days as being the go-to guy for tracking down insurgents and deserters and finding improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Unfortunately one IED found Walter before he could find it, resulting in severe brain damage with a lasting and unexpected effect. Walter transformed from someone skilled at the standard recovery of people and things in wartime scenarios to someone - something - much more extraordinary: a Finder. Walter left the military, but his reputation as a discreet professional able to unearth anything and anyone passed on to generals, politicians and other powerful figures. \n\n\nVertaling: Jesse, Quetsbeek en DÃƒÂ©sirÃƒÂ©e\n\n\nSeizoen 1 Aflevering 7: Eye of the Storm\n\nWhile a hurricane rages in Southern Florida, Walter helps Isabel find a missing high school girl from Ends of the Earth; the weather forces Willa's probation officer to hole up at the bar.\n\n\n\n\nDeze serie wordt u aangeboden door het DutchReleaseTeam.\nVoor de reviews van de nieuwste films, muziek, series, games etc\nga dan eens naar http://www.hetmultimediacafe.be/\n\n\nKijk ook eens op http://filmtutorials.nl, tutorials over oa converteren, ondertiteling toevoegen en nog veel meer!\n\nDutchReleaseteam = Hardcoded Dutch Subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6365c80036e4fcbc6169a3cedabdc449cf787d04","amp;dn":"The+Finder+S01E07+HDTV+Nl+subs+DutchReleaseTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6365c80036e4fcbc6169a3cedabdc449cf787d04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,101,200,0,54,228,252,188,97,105,163,206,218,189,196,73,207,120,125,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
