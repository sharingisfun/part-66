All you have to run the screensavers is to mount the .dmg files and double click on the .saver files in order to install them into the System Preferences (Desktop &amp; Screen Saver)on your MAC.  I named all of the .dmg files with their system requirements so you don't have to find the system requirements stuff.  Hope you like them!!\n\n\n\n3D Desktop Screensavers:\n\nAquarium\nButterflies\nCars\nDogs\nSpace Wars\nDolphins\nZombies\n\n\nOther Desktop Screensavers:\n\nAutodesk Time FX \nHelios\nHills\nHyperspace\nLotsaWater\nPlasma Tunnel\nSkyrocket\nX-Galaxy\n\n\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4208813f7dc65f4c50f879a02946f9988d4ef62","amp;dn":"Top+ScreenSavers+for+MAC+Snow+Leopard+%26amp%3B+Lion+%28Including+3Ds%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4208813f7dc65f4c50f879a02946f9988d4ef62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,32,136,19,247,220,101,244,197,15,135,154,2,148,111,153,136,212,239,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
