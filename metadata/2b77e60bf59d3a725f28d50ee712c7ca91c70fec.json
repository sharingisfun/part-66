They dream of one day proving themselves on the battlefield. One day, however, Hyou is taken to the palace by a minister. Winding up on the losing side of a power-struggle, Hyou manages to return to the village, barely alive. Shin then meets a boy who closely resembles Hyou, Ei Sei. For now he is the king of Qin; later he will become the emperor Shi Huangdi. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b77e60bf59d3a725f28d50ee712c7ca91c70fec","amp;dn":"Kingdom+01-02+%5B1280x720+English-Subbed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b77e60bf59d3a725f28d50ee712c7ca91c70fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,119,230,11,245,157,58,114,95,40,213,14,231,18,199,202,145,199,15,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
