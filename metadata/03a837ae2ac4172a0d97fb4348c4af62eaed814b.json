Suppose you saw a friend's spouse cheating -- would you tell her? What if you saw a young girl being cruelly taunted by other girls - would you confront them? Using hidden cameras, ''Primetime: What Would You Do?'' sets up everyday scenarios and then captures people's reactions. Whether they're compelled to act or mind their own business, John Quinones reports on their split-second - and often surprising - decision-making process.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03a837ae2ac4172a0d97fb4348c4af62eaed814b","amp;dn":"what.would.you.do.2012-03-09.teens.and.sex-teens.and.botox.hdtv.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03a837ae2ac4172a0d97fb4348c4af62eaed814b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,168,55,174,42,196,23,42,13,151,251,67,72,196,175,98,234,237,129,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
