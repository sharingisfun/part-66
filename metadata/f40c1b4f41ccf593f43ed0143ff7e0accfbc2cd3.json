Look at review at Appadvice.com to know more about this game:http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/05/quickadvice-battleshipalieninvaders\n\nThe plot is basically as simple as Ã¢â‚¬Å“we'd find them, or they'd find usÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you have to observe the moves of alien ship, predict its whereabouts and fire missiles to destroy it before the enemy gets a chance to approach your warship. \n\nCombining elements of shooting and strategy game, this battleship game can give you an exciting gaming experience while still leaving space for calculation and strategy. You need to carefully observe every move of the alien warship to deploy your missile to wait for them and command it to fire at the right moment the ship comes by. \nSince it takes a few moments for the missile to hit its objective, you got to develop a sense of timing to balance the speed of the missile and the speed of the intruding battleship. You are only armed with 4 missiles in one game level, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite challenging as you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford to miss the target too many times and the acts of your enemy will get more and more complicating to predict at advanced level. \n\nWhile Battleship is more about quiet thinking, the simple yet strong graphic design and stunning sound effects can give you real feeling of a naval combat. It employs an easy-to-use interface of the radar screen with red spots representing the presence of the enemy ship.\n\nHOW TO PLAY?\n\nPlayer have to predict where the alien ships move and launch missiles just in time before the alien ships approachs their ship. \n\nFEATURE\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ INSPIRED FROM A INCREDIBLE ALIEN NAVAL WAR MOVIE\nOne of the best screens in the movie becomes a incridible game!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ EASY AND LIFE-LIKE CONTROL\nPredict, lock and fire like a Destroyer.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ EXCITING AND CHALLENGING \nYou need to be focus all the time because you will never guess the way the alien ships move and how they approachs you.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ METICULOUS DESGIN AND EXCITING SOUND EFFECTS\nFeel the emeny with an enviroment which created by meticulous details and exciting music/sound effects.\n...
