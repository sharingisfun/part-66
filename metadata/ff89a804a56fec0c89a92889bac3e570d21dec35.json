Matt Damon stars in the thriller The Adjustment Bureau as a man who glimpses the future Fate has planned for him and realizes he wants something else. To get it, he must pursue the only woman he's ever loved across, under and through the streets of modern-day New York.\n\nOn the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris (Damon) meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt)-a woman like none he's ever known. But just as he realizes he's falling for her, mysterious men conspire to keep the two apart.\n\nDavid learns he is up against the agents of Fate itself-the men of The Adjustment Bureau - who will do everything in their considerable power to prevent David and Elise from being together. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path... or risk everything to defy Fate and be with her.\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau is written for the screen and directed by George Nolfi (writer of Ocean's Twelve, co-writer of The Bourne Ultimatum). It is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (Total Recall, Minority Report and Blade Runner).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff89a804a56fec0c89a92889bac3e570d21dec35","amp;dn":"Adjustment+Bureau%2C+The+%5B2011+PAL+DVD%5D%5BEn.De.Tr+Multisubs%5B8%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff89a804a56fec0c89a92889bac3e570d21dec35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,137,168,4,165,111,236,12,137,169,40,137,186,195,229,112,210,29,236,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
