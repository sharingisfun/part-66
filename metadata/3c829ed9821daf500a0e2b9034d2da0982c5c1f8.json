He scrounges food from the vendors and steals mechanical parts from the owner of a toy shop, Georges Melies. In fact, HugoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father was a watchmaker and he has inherited his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talents for all things mechanical. Years before, HugoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father found an intricate mechanical man, but they could never figure out how it worked. Hugo befriends MeliesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ward, Isabelle, and together they have an adventure, one that centers around Melies himself.\n\nMovie Trailer:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://outlawvideos.net/hugo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://outlawvideos.net/hugo/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c829ed9821daf500a0e2b9034d2da0982c5c1f8","amp;dn":"Hugo+MP4+%28Apple%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c829ed9821daf500a0e2b9034d2da0982c5c1f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,130,158,217,130,29,175,80,10,14,43,144,52,210,218,9,130,197,193,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
