With one bite, it's only hours before victims will turn into zombies and hunt for human flesh. Morgan, Ash, and Johnny might just be the only humans left, but they don't seem to mind and find enjoyment lounging around in their underwear living in vacant homes. When they stumble upon a hot girl who just may have a cure, the three decide it's finally time to step up to the plate and save the world- and the girl. Now the only hope for survival lies in their hands.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 600x256 - 23.976fps - 1h 33mn 16s 132ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61712c500639cb0ecbebe1c4c9df09c93d42c11e","amp;dn":"Last+of+the+Living+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61712c500639cb0ecbebe1c4c9df09c93d42c11e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,113,44,80,6,57,203,14,203,235,225,196,201,223,9,201,61,66,193,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
