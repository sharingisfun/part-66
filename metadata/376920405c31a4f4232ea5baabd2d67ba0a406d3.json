It uses the same calendar database as iCal, so it syncs with all your devices as usual, and all your events are there-no migration needed!\n\nCaliander is all about removing the effort it takes to maintain a calendar. Here are some of the top benefits:\n\n* Adding events as easy as pressing Command-N and typing &quot;fri 5 pm\n  After Work&quot;. x5 faster than fooling around with the mouse!\n\n* Timeline based dynamic presentation that sheds the limitations of old,\n  static paper calendars.\n\n* Switch on the perceptual log mode and the distant future is squeezed\n  together to show the more import near future in greater detail. You'll see\n  today's schedule in great detail, but still be reminded of all the things\n  coming up in the next couple of days. You won't miss mum's birthday\n  again!\n\nNo Lock In!\n\nBecause it uses the Mac OS X Calendar Store, the same calendar database that iCal uses, you don't have to be afraid of your events being stuck in some proprietary format. Everything you do in Caliander immediately shows up in iCal and vice versa.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Fixes an issue that caused all day events during daylight saving\n  transitions to not end on an even day.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.6 or greater\n\n---- PLEASE SEED ----\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:376920405c31a4f4232ea5baabd2d67ba0a406d3","amp;dn":"Caliander+v.+1.0.10+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"376920405c31a4f4232ea5baabd2d67ba0a406d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,105,32,64,92,49,164,244,35,46,165,186,171,210,214,123,160,164,6,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
