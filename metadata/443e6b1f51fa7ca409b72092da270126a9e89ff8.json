Mammoths have transfixed humans since the depths of the last Ice Age, when their herds roamed across what is now Europe and Asia. Although these curious members of the elephant family have now been extinct for thousands of years, scientists can now paint an incredibly detailed picture of their lives thanks to whole carcasses that have been beautifully preserved in the Siberian permafrost. Alice meets the scientists who are using the latest genetic, chemical and molecular tests to reveal the adaptations that allowed mammoths to evolve from their origins in the tropics, to surviving the extremes of Siberia. And in a dramatic end to the film, she helps unveil a brand new woolly mammoth carcass that may shed new light on our own ancestors' role in their extinction\n\nWoolly Mammoth - Secrets From The Ice\n_____________________________________________________\n\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 59mn 12s\nBit rate                                 : 1 529 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 59mn 12s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 111 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:443e6b1f51fa7ca409b72092da270126a9e89ff8","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Woolly+Mammoth+-+Secrets+From+The+Ice+-+TVrip+-+Xvid+-+Sli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"443e6b1f51fa7ca409b72092da270126a9e89ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,62,107,31,81,250,124,164,9,183,32,146,218,39,1,38,169,232,159,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
