Genetic anthropologist Svante PÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤bo is teasing the genetic secrets out of bones that have lain buried as glaciers advanced and retreated over Europe. Today, the building is sweltering, the air conditioning is out, but PÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤bo is coolly confident that he has found a way to reassemble the genetic code of a Neanderthal who lived in Croatia 45,000 years ago and who may provide answers to some important questions: Were Neanderthals a separate species from us? Did they interbreed with modern humans? Do their genes survive in modern humans?\n\n&quot;The big picture is that modern humans came out of Africa and replaced Neanderthals,&quot; says PÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤bo, a bristly browed Swede with a penchant for wearing sandals and goofy socks. &quot;The really important question is what the mutations are that became fixed in [modern] humans. What are these things that are unique to us with respect to Neanderthals?&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41d439106f36d9f2c1986245455a4a925a5eddb0","amp;dn":"Neanderthal+Code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41d439106f36d9f2c1986245455a4a925a5eddb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,212,57,16,111,54,217,242,193,152,98,69,69,90,74,146,90,94,221,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
