In some cases a set of Brushes may have been \n\ndivided between two packs, so don't freak out if you find one half in one pack and \n\nwonder where the other is.\n\n\n\nAll the Brushes  are compatible with Photoshop 7 to Photoshop CS 5.1. and Win98 to \n\nWin7 .Some are not compatible because of change in Commands and rearranging of \n\npanels from version to version, but such Brushes are not more than 1% .\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to supply a list of Brushes included because the description \n\npage of TPB will not accept such a huge list and moreover the compilation would be \n\na huge task. But, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed :).\n\n\n\nIn Win 7 Copy / Paste the Action in -  &quot;C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Photoshop \n\nCS5.1PresetsBrushes&quot;  Folder. A similar Folder is available in lower Windows OS.\n\nRefer the manuals on how to work with Brushes from within Photoshop. If you are \n\nnot familiar with Photoshop Brushes, I can guarantee that this will be a start of \n\na very beautiful  relationship  with  Brushes. Most are not aware of the vast  \n\npotential these Tools hold .\n\n\n\nTHE  UPLOADS ARE ESSENTIALLY FOR 32  BITS SYSTEMS AND WINDOWS OS ONLY. THEY MAY OR \n\nMAY NOT WORK ON 64 BITS OR OTHER OS.\n\n=============================================================================\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY !\n\nTHE PACKS ARE VIRUS / MALWARE FREE.\n\nALL CREDIT TO AN ARMY OF UPLOADERS\n\nLEAVE COMMENTS FOR OTHER DOWNLOADERS TO REFER.\n\nAND REMEMBER TO ENJOY ! OR THE ACTIONS WON'T WORK  : )\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\nThe moment God is figured out with nice neat lines and definitions, we are no \n\nlonger dealing with God.\n\n===============================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54a2d469f5c3e603574fda7921deb62a8fdc640","amp;dn":"Photoshop+Brushes+Pack+01+of+32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54a2d469f5c3e603574fda7921deb62a8fdc640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,74,45,70,159,92,62,96,53,116,253,167,146,29,235,98,168,253,198,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
