The film blends WavyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own words with magical stories from an extraordinary array of fellow travelers both cultural and counter-cultural, revealing the man behind the clownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grin and the foolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clothing.\n\nIn Saint MisbehavinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wavy is revealed more than the tie-dyed entertainer and ice-cream flavor namesake that often defines him in the popular imagination. Audiences will come to know the activist, the optimist, and the healer who reaches beyond political, economic, and cultural divisions in his commitment to social change and the alleviation of human suffering.\n\nWavyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is his message, serving as deeply needed inspiration that we can change the world and have fun doing it.\n\n[quote=griezzel]This is a seriously awe inspiring documentary. I ripped the essential extras, because they are essential. Source was a DVD9 (7.09 GB).[/quote]\nAll 14 Amazon reviews were given 5 stars.\n\n[URL=http://www.rippleeffectfilms.com/wwwavy/index.php]Official Film Website[/URL]\n[URL=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/47100/saint-misbehavin-the-wavy-gravy-movie/]DVD Talk Review[/URL]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3c9a2c6cfef0a29cfc9c3dea84c5ec69cac636","amp;dn":"Saint+Misbehavin+-+The+Wavy+Gravy+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3c9a2c6cfef0a29cfc9c3dea84c5ec69cac636","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,60,154,44,108,254,240,162,156,252,156,61,234,132,197,236,105,202,198,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
