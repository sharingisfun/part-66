Enjoy~\n\nCreated by Mark Waid and Mike Wieringo, Bart Allen first showed up in 1994. Born and raised in the 30th Century, Bart was the grandson of Barry Allen, the second person to use the name Ã¢â‚¬ËœFlashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the DCU. Barry and his wife Iris had spent time in the far future because Iris was born in that era. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask. Anyway, while in the future, Barry and Iris had twins. It was Don Allen, son of Barry, who was BartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father. Raised by himself in an isolation chamber, BartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s young metabolism raged out of control, making him grow at a startling speed.\n\nFrom Flash (Vol. 2) #92 (1994)\nBartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandmother, Iris, removed him from governmental control and whisked him back to the late 20th Century where she hoped her nephew, Wally, could train Bart in the use of his powers. Wally, who had taken over the role of the Flash after his uncle Barry died, quickly found himself in over his head with the teenager. Bart barely listened to direction, thought everything was a game, and generally became a thorn in his mentorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side. Wally had to call in reinforcements to help teach his new apprentice.\n\nFrom Flash (Vol. 2) #96 (1994)\nFlanked by speedster veterans Max Mercury, Jay Garrick, Jesse Quick, and her father Johnny Quick, Wally helped Bart reset his metabolism to normal and learn to take superheroing seriously.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d932ee968100069ef9455c4c79b35a035a4b00a","amp;dn":"Impulse+%28Bart+Allen%29+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d932ee968100069ef9455c4c79b35a035a4b00a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,147,46,233,104,16,0,105,239,148,85,196,199,155,53,160,53,164,176,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
