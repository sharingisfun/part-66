The asexual community hopes to foster dialogue about the sexual orientation of asexuality, defined by a lack of sexual attraction to other people, and related identities. The documentary features both members of the asexual community and people from outside the community (including well-known sex columnist Dan Savage), who react to it with everything from bewilderment to open hostility to enthusiastic support.\n\nThis is an unofficial low-resolution rip meant for educational purposes.
