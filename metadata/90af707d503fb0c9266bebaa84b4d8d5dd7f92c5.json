It is a heart-warming account of the Easter story as seen through the eyes of a lovable pig (Horace), a faint-hearted horse (Monty), a pedantic rat (Slink), a rambling rooster (Drake), a motherly cow (Esmay) and a downtrodden donkey (Jack). This magnificent period piece with its epic sets is a roller coaster ride of emotions. Enveloped in humor, this quest follows the animals from the stable in Bethlehem to the great temple in Jerusalem and onto the hillside of Calvary as these unlikely heroes try to save their friend.\n\nGenre: Animation\nIMDB rating: 3.2/10 from 123 users\nDirected by: Deryck Broom, Roger Hawkins\nStarring: Michael Madsen, Ernest Borgnine and Leon Clingman\n\nRelease Name: The.Lion.of.Judah.2011.BDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER\nSize: 700MB\nVideo: XviD | 624Ãƒâ€”3532 | 977 Kbps\nAudio English | MP3 | 128 Kbps\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish\nRuntime: 1h 27min\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90af707d503fb0c9266bebaa84b4d8d5dd7f92c5","amp;dn":"The+Lion+of+Judah+2011+BDRip+XviD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90af707d503fb0c9266bebaa84b4d8d5dd7f92c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,175,112,125,80,63,176,201,38,107,235,170,132,180,216,213,221,127,146,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
