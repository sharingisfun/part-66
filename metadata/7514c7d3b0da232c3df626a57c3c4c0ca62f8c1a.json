Rename 'Tekken 3.bat' to 'Tekken 3.txt'\n2. Open 'Tekken 3.txt', and change the drive letter in the path to the bin file to your\ndrive letter\n3. Save the file in notepad, then close it\n4. Rename 'Tekken 3.txt' back to 'Tekken 3.bat'\n\nAnd the launcher should then work :-)\n\nThis can also be used to set up your own custom directory for the game, but I would only\nrecommend you change anything if you are sure that you know what you are doing!\n\n\nHope this little pack helps anyone struggling with Tekken 3 emulation :-D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7514c7d3b0da232c3df626a57c3c4c0ca62f8c1a","amp;dn":"Tekken+3+%28fully+working+with+sound%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7514c7d3b0da232c3df626a57c3c4c0ca62f8c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,20,199,211,176,218,35,44,61,246,38,165,124,60,76,12,166,47,140,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
