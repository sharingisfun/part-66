This mod was created for the original hellgate london game, single player version. The torrent does not contain any of the original hellgate game files. It is the Mod only.\n\nI'm posting this because i had to do some legwork to find all the files listed as needed in the forums. It's a great mod that fixes a lot of the slop left hanging by flagship, and adds some new content from updates that were only provided for the multiplayer version of the game.\n\nContents:\n\n-Revival Mod version 1.5b.1\n-Revival 1.5b.1 launcher (required to launch the current version of the mod)\n-Chest Fix mod (1.5b.1 has a bug that keeps chests from dropping. this patch fixes that)\n-Revival Launcher (old)(required to install the chest fix patch; the new launcher won't do it)\n-the last multiplayer patch released by Flagship (this was hard to find/download reliably to and is the main reason i'm posting this)\n\nI know that the SP 1.2 patch from flagship IS ALSO REQUIRED to run this mod, but you can find that file all over the web (on the mod site even!) so, i'm skipping it.\n\n\nI am just a player of the game/mod.
