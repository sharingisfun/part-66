Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b648f639731482ba98682c9d21e2454ffd3d0ab","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+10+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b648f639731482ba98682c9d21e2454ffd3d0ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,100,143,99,151,49,72,43,169,134,130,201,210,30,36,84,255,211,208,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
