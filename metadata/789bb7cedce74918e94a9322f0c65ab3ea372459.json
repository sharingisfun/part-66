Featuring two play modes, you can either fight a roster of Robots (Tournament Mode), each more challenging than the last, or fight in a quick sparring match against your favorite opponents (Free Sparring Mode). Your primary objective: defeat Midas and unlock all 8 unique Robots.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:789bb7cedce74918e94a9322f0c65ab3ea372459","amp;dn":"Real+Steel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"789bb7cedce74918e94a9322f0c65ab3ea372459","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,155,183,206,220,231,73,24,233,74,147,34,240,198,90,179,234,55,36,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
