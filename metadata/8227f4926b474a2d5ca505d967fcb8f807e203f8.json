Then open more applications at once without any delays.\n\nIf you are in the middle of using an application and the system becomes unresponsive for several seconds it could be the memory manager recovering cache memory for your application. \n\niFreeMem optimise feature is a quick and easy alternative to either a reboot or RAM upgrade to get defragmented free memory.\niFreeMem free's memory from the in-memory cache that accumulates with every file or application read from hard-disk.\n\nThe cache is good, but it can become cluttered with files you don't even need cached anymore that take up precious RAM.\n\nMaximum free memory can sometimes be better than half your memory filled with old cached files.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mac OSX 10.3.9 (Panther) or\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mac OSX 10.4.x (Tiger) or\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mac OSX 10.5.x (Leopard)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard)\n\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8227f4926b474a2d5ca505d967fcb8f807e203f8","amp;dn":"iFreemem+v.+3.5.0a+with+%5BK%5Drack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8227f4926b474a2d5ca505d967fcb8f807e203f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,39,244,146,107,71,74,45,92,165,5,217,103,252,184,248,7,226,3,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
