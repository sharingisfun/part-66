Griffith, William Q. Judge, Swami Paramananda\n\nThe Bagavad Gita is a conversation between Lord Krishna and the Pandava prince Arjuna taking place on the battlefield before the start of the \nKurukshetra War. Responding to Arjuna's confusion and moral dilemma about fighting his own cousins, Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a \nwarrior and prince, and elaborates on different Yogic and Vedantic \nphilosophies, with examples and analogies. This has led to the Gita often being described as a concise guide to Hindu theology and also as a practical, \nself-contained guide to life. During the discourse, Lord Krishna reveals His identity as the Supreme Being Himself (Svayam Bhagavan), blessing Arjuna with an awe-inspiring vision of His divine universal form. \n\nTwo words that are of paramount importance in grasping the Upanishads are Brahman and Atman. The Brahman is the universal spirit and the Atman is the individual Self. Differing opinions exist amongst scholars regarding the etymology of these words. Brahman comes from the root brh which means &quot;The Biggest ~ The Greatest ~ The ALL&quot;. Brahman is &quot;the infinite Spirit Source and fabric and core and destiny of all existence, both manifested and unmanifested and the formless infinite substratum and from whom the universe has grown&quot;. Brahman is the ultimate, both transcendent and immanent, the absolute infinite existence, the sum total of all that ever is, was, or shall be. The word Atman means the immortal perfect Spirit of any living creature, being, including trees etc. The idea put forth by the Upanishadic seers that Atman and Brahman are One and the same is one of the greatest contributions made to the thought of the world. \n\nThe Rigveda is an ancient Indian sacred collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns. It is counted among the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism known as the Vedas. Some of its verses are still recited as Hindu prayers, at religious functions and other occasions, putting these among the world's oldest religious texts in continued use. The Rigveda contains several mythological and poetical accounts of the origin of the world, hymns praising the gods, and ancient prayers for life, prosperity, etc.\n\nFile Size: 1066 KB\nPrint Length: 740 pages\nPublisher: Theophania Publishing (June 26, 2011)\nLanguage: English\n\nEnjoy! :)\n\nPeace and Love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d73f89b27af1e5847871143db7f4edebca151993","amp;dn":"A+Book+of+Hindu+Scriptures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d73f89b27af1e5847871143db7f4edebca151993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,63,137,178,122,241,229,132,120,113,20,61,183,244,237,235,202,21,25,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
