(Latest version)\nContains svencoop itself and HL1+OpFor content for cooperative walkthrough.\nNothing is cut off or recoded.\n\nSven Co-op (usually abbreviated as SC) is a cooperative game multiplayer modification for the first-person shooter computer game Half-Life, where players must work together against AI controlled enemies (NPCs), solve puzzles and complete other objectives (usually specified in a MOTD) as a team.\nThe game was originally created and released by Daniel 'Sven Viking' Fearon as a small mod with two single player maps and the game configured to allow NPCs in the game (by changing a CVAR to allow them to exist in the multiplayer game mode). Sven Co-op was released on January 19, 1999 - before Valve's Team Fortress Classic - and is therefore the oldest Half-Life mod that is still in development. It has since grown to become a full blown mod, with a full team, and one of the most played games on Steam as of September 18, 2006, excluding the official games by Valve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dad70218e6e5a33015f325acd6a59be91379234","amp;dn":"Sven+Coop+4.6+Full+Repack+%28HL1%2C+OpFor+content+included%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dad70218e6e5a33015f325acd6a59be91379234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,173,112,33,142,110,90,51,1,95,50,90,205,106,89,190,145,55,146,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
