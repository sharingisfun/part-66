For shunting duties within your freight yards, there is also the distinctive and tiny BR323 shunter in the correct red livery, a low-powered locomotive which could be found at most large stations in the 1970s. Also included are 32 freight wagons with different loads and liveries, considerably expanding the available freight stock for German routes in TS2012. With 6 scenarios included, there is plenty of variety and lots to keep you occupied as you take on the role of German freight train driver, 1970s-style!\n\nIncludes\nBR151 Green\nBR151 Blue&amp;Cream\nBR323 Red\nFAD167 Hopper\nGBS254 Wagon\nIbbhs396 Coolwagon\nKds56/UCS909 Powder Tanker\nOmm52 Bulk Wagon\nOmmi51 F-z 120\nKmmgks/Tis858","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038785d825dbf6e84fa34680c99397f481c09469","amp;dn":"DB+Freight+1970s+Add-On.rwp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038785d825dbf6e84fa34680c99397f481c09469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,135,133,216,37,219,246,232,79,163,70,128,201,147,151,244,129,192,148,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
