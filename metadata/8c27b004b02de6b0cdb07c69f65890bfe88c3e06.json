Alongside \nlongtime voiceover veteran and living legend JUNE FORAY, Blanc's \noriginal song, recorded in character in the late 1040s, provides the \nbackground tune to this all-new Sylvester vs. Tweety animated romp.\n\nIn timeless Looney Tunes fashion, the never-ending game of cat versus \nbird transpires in Granny's placid high-rise apartment while the sweet \nold woman naps. As Tweety Bird creatively avoids the clutches of \nSylvester the Cat, the famished feline goes to outrageous lengths to \nsecure his supper. A musical chase tears through Granny's home as the \ntwo juggle their roles of predator and prey, all while singing a catchy \nduet. With their manic antics framed by the original Blanc &quot;Puddy Tat&quot; \nsong, the epic chase only ends when Granny wakes up and takes matters \ninto her own hands.\n\nMore info @ http://thatsallfolks.com\n\n\nNote: This video is meant to be played on the 3DS\n\nResolution: 400x224 (original aspect ratio)\n\n\nInstall:\n\nCopy the video to the DCIM/100NIN03 directory of your SD card\nOpen the Nintendo 3DS Camera app and press View Photos/Videos\nWait for the 3DS to update the management file and say thanks\n\nTip: You can hide the information icons on the 3D screen\nGo to Settings, Info Display and tap Off and Confirm\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c27b004b02de6b0cdb07c69f65890bfe88c3e06","amp;dn":"%5B3DS+Video%5D+Loony+Tunes+-+I+Tawt+I+Taw+a+Puddy+Tat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c27b004b02de6b0cdb07c69f65890bfe88c3e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,39,176,4,176,45,230,176,205,176,124,105,246,88,144,191,232,140,62,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
