The Dutch offer the best of men equally too!\n\nThe frustration of the Dutch with the incompetence of Canadian styled\nstupidity is highlighted towards the end of this movie when a\nranking Army officer from a Canadian involved regiment is referred\nto as a &quot;Canadian asshole&quot; by the Dutch who are overwhelmed by the lack\nof genius in the life and death decision that they see is made with no\nregard to merit whatsoever. tut! tut!\n\n\nThe treatment of the character of Ms. Rachel Stein in having to literally\nendure being inundated in merde for being viewed as a collaborator\nis a disgusting sight that defies all human sanity of any decency whatever.\nIt certainly lacks all understanding of the concepts of merit or \ntrue decency on the part of the mob which inflicts its own brand\nof justice.
