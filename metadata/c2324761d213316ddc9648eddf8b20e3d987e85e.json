They reveal themselves to be the Mars People and their goal is to provide their future leader with special advanced weaponry to take on his enemies in the present. \n\n\n\n\nClassic Metal Slug characters Marco, Tarma, Fio, Eri, Ralf, and Clark return once again to take on General Morden and his new and improved Rebel Army.\nMetal Slug XX is a side-scrolling, arcade-style, run-and-gun shooter for PSP where players can choose between six zany characters and shoot through seven action-packed levels with varying obstacles, numerous enemies, and diverging paths. Confident players can put their skills to the test by playing more than 70 mission-based trials in &quot;Combat School.&quot; Leona can also be unlocked, although I'm not sure how.\n\nThis is my first torrent, so constructive comments are welcome!\nPlease seed guys, and enjoy!:P\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2324761d213316ddc9648eddf8b20e3d987e85e","amp;dn":"Metal+Slug+XX+%28decrypted%2C+with+emulator%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2324761d213316ddc9648eddf8b20e3d987e85e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,50,71,97,210,19,49,109,220,150,72,237,223,139,32,227,217,135,232,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
