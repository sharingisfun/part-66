A substance recovered from a meteor, it has the same properties of anti-matter. Called ICE-10 is a dooms day substance that if released would start a chain reaction destroying the world. Created as a weapon of last resort, it was kept in the far north where the cold helped keep it under control. The deadliness of this material becomes evident when a military plane is dispatched to bring back a small amount for testing. When the plane crashes, the material escapes and an entire town in Northern Canada is wiped out.\n\n\nRelease Date: 02-04-2012\nFilename: Super.Tanker.2011.DVDRip.XviD-USi\nSource: DVD\nSize: 712 MB\nGenre: Sci-Fi\nVideo: 624 x 352 | 972 Kbps\nAudio: English Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 192 Kbps\nSubs: NA\nIMDB Rating: 2.2/10\nRT Critics: NA\nDirected By: Jeffery Scott Lando\nStarring: Velizar Binev, Callum Blue and Sarah Brown\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:091bb9b72e33d2faeadee870f9b151b9c1ee1658","amp;dn":"Super.Tanker.2011.DVDRip.XviD-USi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"091bb9b72e33d2faeadee870f9b151b9c1ee1658","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,27,185,183,46,51,210,250,234,222,232,112,249,177,81,185,193,238,22,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
