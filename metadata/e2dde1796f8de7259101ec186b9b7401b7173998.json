The Zork Trilogy is set in the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground. You, a dauntless treasure-hunter, are venturing into this dangerous land in search of wealth and adventure. Because each part of the Zork saga is a completely independent story, you can play them in any order. However, because Zork I is the least difficult, it is usually the best place to begin. Many strange tales have been told of the fabulous treasure, exotic creatures, and diabolical puzzles in the Great Underground Empire. As an aspiring adventurer, you will undoubtedly want to locate these treasures and deposit them in your trophy case. You'd better equip yourself with a source of light (for the caverns are dark) and weapons (for some of the inhabitants are unfriendly - especially the thief, a skilled pickpocket and ruthless opponent).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://bayimg.com/dAOPHaADc&quot; title=&quot;http://bayimg.com/dAOPHaADc&quot;&gt;http://bayimg.com/dAOPHaADc&lt;/a&gt; \n\n------------------------------------------------\nInstruction on how to use the torrent:\n\n1) Extract all the files from the archive provided in the torrent;\n2) To launch the game click on &quot;DUNGEON.EXE&quot; executive file.\n------------------------------------------------\nImportant note:\n\nThis game is a flashback to MS-DOS era, so it will be relevant to use it without any modification from your side only on operating systems up to Windows XP (including Windows XP).\n\nTo launch the game on the latest operating systems (Windows Vista, Windows 7) you should use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dosbox.com&quot; title=&quot;http://www.dosbox.com&quot;&gt;DOSBox application&lt;/a&gt;.
