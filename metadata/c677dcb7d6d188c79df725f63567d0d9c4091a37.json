But it seems he would take some time out from his other schedules would come to Hrishi da and ask him if he could shoot the next scene from Anand. That's how eager and dedicated he was to Anand. Probably he knew that this was the movie that he would be remembered for.\n\nThe movie narrates like the pages of a diary of one Dr. Bhaskar Bannerjee and his relationship with Anand Sehgal who he treated for cancer. Despite of such a heavy theme the movie is high spirited just like Anand Sehgal who likes to laugh in the face of death. Special mention should be made for attention given to each character in the movie. All the characters are well etched and everyone has given a truly inspired performance.\n\nThe last sequence must be the most dramatic sequence that I have seen in any movie. Music by Salil Chaudhary and lyrics by Yogesh and Gulzar are apt and wonderful. Definitely one of the best movies made in India.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSharing is Caring...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c677dcb7d6d188c79df725f63567d0d9c4091a37","amp;dn":"Anand+-+1970+-+Classic+of+Rajesh+Khanna+%28SaMeep104%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c677dcb7d6d188c79df725f63567d0d9c4091a37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,119,220,183,214,209,136,199,157,247,37,246,53,103,208,217,196,9,26,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
