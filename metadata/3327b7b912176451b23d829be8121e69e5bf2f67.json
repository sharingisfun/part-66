As an honors student who was also good at sports, the charming boy was popular with his classmates. When he suddenly died, his classmates decided to carry on as if he was still alive until graduation. Then, in the spring of 1998, a boy named Sakakibara Kouichi transfers to the class, and he grows suspicious of the fearful atmosphere in that classroom. In particular, there is a beautiful, aloof girl named Mei Misaki who wears an eyepatch and is always alone drawing pictures. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3327b7b912176451b23d829be8121e69e5bf2f67","amp;dn":"Another+Complete+Episodes+%281+-+22%29+Incl.+OVA+%28Ep+00%29+%5BHQ+720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3327b7b912176451b23d829be8121e69e5bf2f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,39,183,185,18,23,100,81,178,61,130,155,232,18,30,105,229,191,47,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
