It is loosely based on the 1990s Spider-Man: The Animated Series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision. Released originally for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in 2000, the game was subsequently ported to the Sega Dreamcast and PC. An alternate was also created for the Game Boy Color.\n(taken from Wikipedia)\n\nOne of my favorite games that I recently found (not on TPB), so I decided to upload it. This is my first upload.
