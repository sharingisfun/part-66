The masseur agrees although he is already having an affair with the wife, and they together work out a way to set up her husband in order that she does get his fortune. But when the client is murdered and the real wife shows up the masseur has to clear his own name, and as he begins to piece together the evidence he realises that he's been played by yet another man who still holds a grudge from years before.\n\n(VHS rip)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107998/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107998/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6ebf7211ca56219f43e1103ef2d6399853ff760","amp;dn":"Rubdown.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6ebf7211ca56219f43e1103ef2d6399853ff760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,235,247,33,28,165,98,25,244,62,17,3,239,45,99,153,133,63,247,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
