I showed people this chart:\n\n\nEveryone agreed that this would be a ridiculous household budget.\n\nBut that's the federal budget, if you just add 8 zeroes!\n\nPeople on the street were horrified at our debt, but when I asked them what they would cut, most had no clue.\n\nSo tonight, with the help of our guests, we will tell them.\n\nStuart Varney, host of Varney &amp; Co. on Fox Business, will join us along with Rich Benjamin, a senior fellow from the progressive think tank Demos, to debate Obama's new budget.\n\nTexas Congressman Jeb Hensarling, House Republican Committee Chairman, will explain why the President's budget creates a debt crisis.\n\nSince we are on the path to Greece, Fox Business correspondent Ashley Webster will join us from Athens, at the heart of Greece's chaotic debt crisis to report on how the Greek people riot over cuts to their giant entitlement state. Here is a sample of that.\n\nOur high debt burden is not just insane, but immoral, says former welfare recipient Star Parker and Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nFinally, even with a busted budget, politicians want you to pay for this: a mandate to force adult film stars to wear condoms. Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy says it's needed for public health and safety, but adult film star Kayden Kross will appear to say that she doesn't want the government's protection.\n\nA lively show, tonight!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a665352dca3593762c44d09171f3789f6caed5eb","amp;dn":"20120216-Stossel-%5BBudget+Insanity%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a665352dca3593762c44d09171f3789f6caed5eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,101,53,45,202,53,147,118,44,68,208,145,113,243,120,159,108,174,213,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
