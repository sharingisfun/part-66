The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.\n\n\n\n--\nVersion 2.1.4 (06/02/2012)\n* Fixed a bug that would cause some systems to fail to boot\n* Fixed a bug where an unsupported OS would fail to have it's status set to unsupported\n* Added Qbex SLIC and certificate\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVirus scanner results\n\nAll virus scanner detection's are a false-positive as long as the MD5 matches. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.\n\nFor info @ ReadME.txt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad12244d2048831f231ef6836def5d166985fb7","amp;dn":"Windows+Loader+v2.1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad12244d2048831f231ef6836def5d166985fb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,209,34,68,210,4,136,49,242,49,239,104,54,222,245,209,102,152,95,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
