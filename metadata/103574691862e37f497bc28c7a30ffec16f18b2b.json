Home-sick and lonely, he will travel back to earth, with his friendly pup Halo, to retrieve a most selfless and precious gift for The Baby Jesus. Experience the love, laughter and magic of one of the most popular children's stories of all time. From the classic book by Charles Tazewell comes the CGI animated film, The Littlest Angel.\n\nThe Littlest Angel isn't a dazzling Blu-ray by any means, but this transfer is serviceable and pleasant. Detail is pretty much limited to the original renderings; it captures the more complex and smoother elements with equal precision. Colors, likewise, are vibrant but simple, lacking any real complexity and playing with only broad shades of green, gold, brown, and other basic hues. The image is relatively clear and crisp. Unfortunately, a few technical problems interfere from time to time. Light aliasing, occasional banding, and a few jagged lines are constants throughout. Still, this is a satisfactory transfer, and the kids will love the bright colors it has to offer. \n\nIMDB Rating: 4.9\n\nimdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869724/\n\nyoutube:\n******************************\nMEDIAINFO\n\nFormat : MPEG-4 at 5 141 Kbps\nLength : 2.99 GiB for 1h 23mn 12s 255ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 4 499 Kbps\nAspect : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en\n\n\n\nVideo Source: DER_KLEINSTE_ENGEL[CHDBITS]\n\nThanks:CHDBITS \nSpecial Thanks to my Mentor[Greyshadow]\n\n\nI provide a small sample, so please download this to check your \ncompatibility first if you are unsure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103574691862e37f497bc28c7a30ffec16f18b2b","amp;dn":"The+Littlest+Angel%5B2011%5D-720p-BDRip+x+264-ac3%28mp4%29%5Bx%40720%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103574691862e37f497bc28c7a30ffec16f18b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,53,116,105,24,98,227,127,73,123,194,140,122,48,255,236,22,241,139,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
