After much consideration, we chose the Santiago show as we felt it was one of our best performances of the entire tour and to play at the prestigious Estadio Nacional was a landmark moment for us. For reasons known to our fans, it took a long time before we got to play our first show in Chile, and once we did get to play a show, the response was so phenomenal we just had to keep coming back, and it s got better and better each time! This show also features the gigantic new Eddie.\n\nGenre: Music | Documentary\nDirectors: Andy Matthews\nActors: Iron Maiden\nRelease Name: Iron.Maiden.En.Vivo.Behind.The.Beast.DOCU.2012.BDRip.XviD-FiCO\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: XviD, 624Ãƒâ€”352, 1110 kbit/s\nAudio: English, MP3, 128 kbit/s\nRuntime: 98 min\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f1554ae3cbd3b61914a40b899a41acfff34750","amp;dn":"Iron.Maiden.En.Vivo.Behind.The.Beast.DOCU.2012.BDRip.XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f1554ae3cbd3b61914a40b899a41acfff34750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,241,85,74,227,203,211,182,25,20,164,11,137,154,65,172,255,243,71,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
