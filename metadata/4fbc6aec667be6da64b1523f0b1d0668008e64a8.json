The two bind themselves to one another, becoming intimate friends and agreeing &quot;there warn't no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.&quot;\n\nAs Huck learns about love, responsibility, and morality, the trip becomes a metaphoric voyage through his own soul, culminating in the glorious moment when he decides to &quot;go to hell&quot; rather than return Jim to slavery.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy, and PLEASE SEED.\nComment on quality for future downloaders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fbc6aec667be6da64b1523f0b1d0668008e64a8","amp;dn":"Adventures+of+Huckleberry+Finn+-++eBook+%5BEPUB%2C+MOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fbc6aec667be6da64b1523f0b1d0668008e64a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,188,106,236,102,123,230,218,100,177,82,63,11,29,6,104,0,142,100,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
