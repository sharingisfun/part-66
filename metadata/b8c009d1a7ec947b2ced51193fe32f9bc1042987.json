He\ncame to the throne as the Renaissance swept across Europe, yet England's new\nking never lost sight of the medieval chivalry of his forefathers. In the first\nof a two-part documentary, architectural historian Jonathan Foyle looks at the\npalaces, tapestries, music and paintings created in Henry's name and questions\nwhether the art he commissioned compensates for the religious treasures he would\ncome to destroy.\n\n\nBBC Henry VIII, Patron Or Plunderer 2 of 2 2009\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lc71z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lc71z&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn the 1530s, King Henry VIII was at a crossroads. In his desperation for a new\nwife and an heir, he had broken with Rome, divorced Catherine of Aragon and\nmarried Anne Boleyn. Isolated and vulnerable, he needed a powerful new image as\nhead of church and state.\n\nIn the second of a two-part documentary, architectural historian Jonathan Foyle\nlooks for clues in the king's art to glimpse what was going on inside Henry's\nhead as he faced his darkest days.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA short sample is included for evaluation.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8c009d1a7ec947b2ced51193fe32f9bc1042987","amp;dn":"Henry+VIII+-+Patron+or+Plunderer%3F+++%28BBC+2009+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8c009d1a7ec947b2ced51193fe32f9bc1042987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,192,9,209,167,236,148,123,44,237,81,25,63,227,47,155,193,4,41,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
