Many people are\nswitching to Auction Auto Bidder after trying the others, make\nthe right choice now and save your money. With the 60 day\nsatisfaction guarantee, you have nothing to loose.\n\nWhy snipe (bid in the last seconds) rather than use eBay's\nproxy-bidding?\n\nWin items at a lower cost since no one will have time to outbid\nyou, if you bid a long time before the end, eBay will email the\nprevious high bidder to let them know they've been outbid so\nthey will most likely come back and outbid you causing the\nprice to increase, this software prevents this and often pays\nfor itself on the first use\nIncrease your chances of winning since people wont have time to\noutbid you\nYou can decide to remove your bid up to the last minute since\nit is only sent to eBay in the last seconds\n\nAlso works as a fully featured web browser optimized to make\nbrowsing eBay faster &amp; easier.\n\nWhat are bid groups?\n\nWith bid groups, you can find several listings of an item you\nwant, add them all to be sniped and place them in a group. Place\nbids from lowest to highest for the auction ending the soonest to\nthe latest respectively (for example, a $30 bid on the listing\nending in 2 hours, a $35 on the one ending in 17 hours, and a $40\non the one ending in 1 day). By doing this, the software will\nattempt to win the first one at your lowest bid, if it wins, all\nother bids in the group are canceled, if you're outbid, it will\ntry to win the second one and so on. This can double your savings\ncompared to using only normal sniping and saves you even more\ntime!\n\nVery easy to use\n\nAuction Auto Bidder is so simple to use that anyone, including\nnovice computer users can be using it within minutes without even\nhaving to read instructions, thanks to the user friendly\ninterface and wizards which make installing and setting up a\nsnipe as simple as entering your maximum bid!
