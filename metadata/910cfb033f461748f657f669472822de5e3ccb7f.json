This release 2001 in the 24bit remastered 'Verve Master Edition' series.\n\nRuntime approx 72 minutes. MONO - hence the small file size.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nIn 1954, producer Norman Granz held a couple of marathon recording sessions featuring vibraphonist Lionel Hampton, pianist Oscar Peterson, bassist Ray Brown, drummer Buddy Rich, and (on April 13) clarinetist Buddy DeFranco. This set has three selections from the DeFranco date (a 17-plus-minute &quot;Flying Home,&quot; the original &quot;Je Ne Sais Pas,&quot; and &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;) and one from the earlier session (&quot;April in Paris&quot;). Hampton is typically exuberant throughout (grunting rather loudly during a few later ensemble choruses on &quot;Flying Home&quot;), DeFranco and Peterson are as swinging as usual, and the overall music is quite joyous. Even if &quot;Flying Home&quot; does not reach Granz's claim of being the best-ever version of the song (one misses the honking tenor and screaming trumpet), this is an excellent and rather spontaneous outing. [The Verve Master Edition also features the tracks &quot;Don't Be That Way,&quot; &quot;These Foolish Things,&quot; &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; and &quot;It's Only a Paper Moon.&quot;]\n\nLionel Hampton - Vibes\nBuddy DeFranco - Clarinet\nOscar Peterson - Piano\nRay Brown - Bass\nBuddy Rich - Drums\n\nTrack 4: Omit Buddy DeFranco\nTrack 8: Omit Lionel Hampton \n\n01.
