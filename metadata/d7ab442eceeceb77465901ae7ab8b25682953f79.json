You might know Taylor from previous solo albums or bands but most likely from Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band. He was the guitar player who also wrote and sang Ã¢â‚¬Å“Snake HillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Air MattressÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Outer SouthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen Maria Taylor play then you have most likely seen Kate in her band either playing keys, drums, or bass, and most importantly, harmonizing the soft beautiful background melodies. Nowadays, Kate and Taylor have joined hand in hand and formed a band. Ladies and Gentlemen, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dead FingersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, might just be what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been waiting for! In a time when guy-girl duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are becoming quite popular, this one is not just some gimmick, however perfect the timing and package may be. You would almost think Kate was married to her manager, or record label exec., who was having them act like they were romantic just to sell tickets and albums. But in fact, this Alabama duo are recently married and the two just recorded their first self titled full length with Bruce Watson (RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough , AA Bondy), and is being released on Big Legal Mess/ Fat Possum Records early 2012. While showing a wide range of styles, ranging from duet styled songs like those of John Prine and Iris DeMent, X, or Lee Hazelwood and Ann Margaret, to straight up great classic rock bands like the Stones, Beatles, or even Traveling Wilburys, this band should find a nice home with fans of more current duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like She and Him, Jenny and Johnny, or Civil Wars.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/03/11/dead-fingers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/03/11/dead-fingers/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7ab442eceeceb77465901ae7ab8b25682953f79","amp;dn":"Dead+Fingers...Dead+Fingers%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7ab442eceeceb77465901ae7ab8b25682953f79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,171,68,46,206,236,235,119,70,89,1,174,122,184,178,86,130,149,63,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
