His early subject is the deceased husband of Linda Parker (Hazel Court), a woman he is attracted to. Hidden in a Cornish tin mine, he conducts his ghastly experiments using  curare  to remove living, beating hearts from undeserving people in order to bring the deserving dead back to life. \n\nDirected by  Sidney J. Furie \nProduced by  George Fowler \nWritten by   Nathan Juran \nStarring  Kieron Moore ,  Hazel Court ,  Ian Hunter \nMusic by Buxton Orr \nCinematography  Stephen Dade \nEditing by  Antony Gibbs \nDistributed by  Caralan Productions Ltd. \nRelease date(s) 1961 \nRunning time 1:31:15\nCountry  United Kingdom \nLanguage  English\n\nThis hard to find, variation on the Frankenstein story really was shot in the beautiful rugged coastal countryside of Cornwall in the UK. Hazel Court is delightfully gorgeous and the movie is a nice time capsule of the vehicles, clothes, and simpler living of 1961.....except for 'the attempts of a Madman to make the perfect Human Being!'    :(\nI made some adjustments using Handbrake and Sony Vegas Movie Studio since my DVD of it really isn't the greatest.\n\nVideo: 720x480.mpg, 4.02GB,  NTSC 29 fps\nAudio: 2 channel Stereo  48kHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3c1a40be2f6974cb8789fb88e34596300b5b4e1","amp;dn":"Doctor+Blood%5C%27s+Coffin+%281961%29.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3c1a40be2f6974cb8789fb88e34596300b5b4e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,193,164,11,226,246,151,76,184,120,159,184,142,52,89,99,0,181,180,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
