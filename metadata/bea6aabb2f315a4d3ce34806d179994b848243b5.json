Their celibate lifestyle is bothering them so much they decide to go and find themselves a woman. In town this gets them into some curious situations and trouble. In the end the lady they find isn't caught by them, but has made herself at home where they have been living while they were gone. She doesn't mind sharing herself with them being the free spirited lady she is. Now some will like this story this far while others will think this is terrible. But this is 1971...still the time of counter cultural thinking and of the make love not war hippie types in the West. Well things eventually go badly as sharing gives way to jealousy and even violence. I better say no more except it has a happy ending for pretty well everybody and the ending may not be what you expected.\n\nDirected by award winning CDN filmmaker Gilles Carle (1928 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2009)\nStarring :  \nDonald Pilon and Rene Blouin as The Males Jean and Emile\nAndree Pelletier as the Free spirit Rita\nKatherine Mousseau\nGuy L'Ecuyer\nA co-production of Canada (Onyx Films) and France (France Film)\nPG-14 partial nudity, sexual situations\nThis is the dubbed in English version\n\nThis movie nicely shows the lovely rustic scenery still to be seen in rural Quebec and the entire cast are pleasant enough people. I added some 1971 commercials and a PSA before and after the movie in the final mpeg2 file. Newport cigarettes, Sharp (featuring the Worlds smallest calculator...the LC8...almost pocket sized...and only $345.00 in 1971 dollars) and Wisk detergent (ring around the collar) before The Males. After it comes VD is for Everybody (1970s PSA) and a Scope mouthwash commercial.\n\nVideo:  720x480 NTSC 29fps 4:3\nAudio:  2 channel stereo 48kHz\nTotal Length:  1:40:25\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea6aabb2f315a4d3ce34806d179994b848243b5","amp;dn":"+The+Males++%281971+-+Les+Males+-+English+dubbed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea6aabb2f315a4d3ce34806d179994b848243b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,166,170,187,47,49,90,77,60,227,72,6,209,121,153,75,132,130,67,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
