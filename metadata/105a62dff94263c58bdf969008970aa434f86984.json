In the TV series it was established that James West didn't\nbecome a Secret Service agent until President Grant appointed him in 1865.\nIn the SNL parody, he works for previous President Lincoln. \nIt was never established that Jim West even met Lincoln, but this is comedy \nand time travel is the theme....so maybe that has something to do with it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:105a62dff94263c58bdf969008970aa434f86984","amp;dn":"SATURDAY+NIGHT+LIVE+--+Robert+Conrad%2C+The+Allman+Brothers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"105a62dff94263c58bdf969008970aa434f86984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,90,98,223,249,66,99,197,139,223,150,144,8,151,10,164,52,248,105,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
