Each Act is a self-contained campaign that can be selected as soon as the game begins. Although the four Acts can be played in any order, they progress in chronological order from first to fourth, so some minor details, such as which agents join or leave the Spookhouse organization as time passes, are easiest to see when the Acts are played in order.\n\nAct I: Dark Reign of the Vampire King\n\nAct II: Tomb of the Underground God\n\nAct III: Windy City Massacre\n\nAct IV: The House on the Edge of Hell\n\n\nXpadder with Xbox360 &amp; generic PS3 controller profiles included.\nScanned with Comodo IS, compressed with 7zip.\n\nPICS.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PANPoaadN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PANPoaadN&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaNaaAado&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaNaaAado&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4075386061485984b521d7826d18deb536c684","amp;dn":"Nocturne+%2B+Xpadder+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4075386061485984b521d7826d18deb536c684","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,64,117,56,96,97,72,89,132,181,33,215,130,109,24,222,181,54,198,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
