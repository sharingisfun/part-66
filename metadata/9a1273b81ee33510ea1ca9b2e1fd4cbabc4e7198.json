Using The Power, you can crash through pre-determined targets and access a shortcut to get ahead of the pack. \n\n ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good number of game modes to play with friends here, the main one being Dominate which pits up to 12 players against each other in a straightforward race. You can get ahead of the pack with efficient uses of the Power, which can be charged up by performing drifts and other stunts in order to plough through buildings and weak urban structures. \n\n Survival mode offers the same frantic gameplay, but does not allow a player to respawn once taken out. Drift Attack is a play for time, with seconds added to your clock by weaving around tight bends, and Frag Attack sees players commanding big rigs and smashing into cop cars for massive damage (and points). This, and the vast array of multiplayer modes, will ensure that Ridge Racer Unbounded at satisfies the many destructive tendencies of petrol heads the world over.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a1273b81ee33510ea1ca9b2e1fd4cbabc4e7198","amp;dn":"xbox+360+ridgeracer+unbounded+for+jtag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a1273b81ee33510ea1ca9b2e1fd4cbabc4e7198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,18,115,184,30,227,53,16,234,28,169,178,225,253,76,186,188,78,113,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
