Our goal was to create a user friendly familiar desktop that stays consistent and stable.  We believe that the wheel shouldn't be reinvented with every new release.  If it works good, leave it alone.  Our focus is on a feature rich, easy to use, familiar user desktop.\n\n\n\nWhile boasting good looks and powerful applications, it requires surprisingly low system resources.
