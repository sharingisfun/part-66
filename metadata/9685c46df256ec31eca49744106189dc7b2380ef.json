Closer to home, Cortell portrays file sharing as more akin to marketing than stealing, and he backs this assertion up by showing that sales for &quot;intellectual property&quot; have actually risen since the rise of P2P.\n\nJorge Cortell-Albert taught Intellectual Property Law and eCommerce for the Multimedia Internet Applications Masters Degree at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain) before he was fired due to pressure from corporate media interests. Jorge is also an active lecturer and researcher focusing on the interplay of business, technology, and intellectual property law, and the impact that interplay has on consumers and politics.\n\nFile Specifications\nSource: online MPEG1 digital archive\nVideo: XVID, 512x288(16:9), 25fps, 435Kbps\nAudio: MP3, 22.05Khz, 31Kbps(VBR), Mono\nDuration: 1 hour, 45 minutes\nPart Size: 350 MB\nRipped by: PolarBear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9685c46df256ec31eca49744106189dc7b2380ef","amp;dn":"Jorge+Cortell+-+Intellectual+Property+Lecture+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9685c46df256ec31eca49744106189dc7b2380ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,133,196,109,242,86,236,49,236,164,151,68,16,97,137,220,123,35,128,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
