If the chapel is destroyed in combat the map will not be completable.\n\nOnce in the nether you have finished the map.\n\n\n\n\nRules: \n\tAny destruction of an island is cheating.\n\tUse of dirt blocks is cheating\n\tDo not try escaping the islands by riding the water to floor level.\n\n\n\n(Note: Untested and uncomplete. This is likely the first level of many in this map)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75833ca3059c234229dd47f306ef460ed3493d8a","amp;dn":"Challenger+map","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75833ca3059c234229dd47f306ef460ed3493d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,131,60,163,5,156,35,66,41,221,71,243,6,239,70,14,211,73,61,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
