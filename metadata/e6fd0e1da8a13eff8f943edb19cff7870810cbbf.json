PRAG is the story of a distant, ever-absent father who, even after passing away, traumatizes all who have known him. And PRAG is the story of a marriage on the verge of collapse, in which Christoffer wants one thing and Maja another. A story of an old love, constantly transformed; at once, rooted, fragile, vulnerable, forgotten and rediscovered. A marriage where secrets, one after the other, come bursting out of the closet.\n\nLanguages: Dannish / English / Czech\n\nSubtitles srt: English / Portuguese / Dannish / Finnish / Swedish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6fd0e1da8a13eff8f943edb19cff7870810cbbf","amp;dn":"Prag+2006+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6fd0e1da8a13eff8f943edb19cff7870810cbbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,253,14,29,168,161,62,255,143,148,62,219,25,207,247,135,8,16,203,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
