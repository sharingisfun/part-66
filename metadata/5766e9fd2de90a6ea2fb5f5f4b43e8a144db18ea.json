When you combine their fortunes, they are the third wealthiest people in the world. Radical libertarians who use their money to oppose government and virtually all regulation as interference with the free market, the Kochs are in a class of their own as players on the American political stage. Their web of influence in the US stretches from state capitals to the halls of congress in Washington DC.\n\nThe Koch brothers fueled the conservative Tea Party movement that vigorously opposes Barack Obama, the US president. They fund efforts to derail action on global warming, and support politicians who object to raising taxes on corporations or the wealthy to help fix AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiscal problems. According to New Yorker writer Jane Mayer, who wrote a groundbreaking exposÃƒÂ© of the Kochs in 2010, they have built a top to bottom operation to shape public policy that has been &quot;incredibly effective. They are so rich that their pockets are almost bottomless, and they can keep pouring money into this whole process&quot;.\n\nKoch industries, the second largest privately-held company in the US, is an oil refining, chemical, paper products and financial services company with revenues of a $100bn a year. Virtually every American household has some Koch product - from paper towels and lumber, to Stainmaster carpet and Lycra in sports clothes, to gasoline for cars. The KochÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political philosophy of rolling back environmental and financial regulations is also beneficial to their business interests.\n\n  edit\n\nAs FLV:http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/10/2011102683719370179.html\nor \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5766e9fd2de90a6ea2fb5f5f4b43e8a144db18ea","amp;dn":"The+Koch+Brothers++2012++03+++Aljazeera+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5766e9fd2de90a6ea2fb5f5f4b43e8a144db18ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,102,233,253,45,233,10,110,162,251,95,95,75,67,232,161,68,219,24,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
