John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War. He requests a position on the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out he is not alone, but meets a wolf he dubs &quot;Two-socks&quot; and a curious Indian tribe. Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, and discovers a white woman who was raised by the Indians. He gradually earns the respect of these native people, and sheds his white-man's ways.\n\nAudio: English.\nSubs.: English, French, Spanish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0b5d51b40cf3f261b7eb4f282531f8d16615cba","amp;dn":"Dances+with+Wolves++%28Extended+Cut%29+-+DVDR+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0b5d51b40cf3f261b7eb4f282531f8d16615cba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,181,213,27,64,207,63,38,27,126,180,242,130,83,31,141,22,97,92,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
