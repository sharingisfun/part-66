However, this weekend the races might be more disputed, as there are at least up to six riders who can fight for the win in Sevlievo.\n\nIn the MX2 class things are very similar, as Jeffrey Herlings did not have any opponent in Valkenswaard, so it is time now for the Dutch rider to defend the red plate on the hard pack of Sevlievo. However, there is another clear favourite to claim the victory this weekend, the British rider Tommy Searle.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mxlarge.com/news/6368-grand-prix-of-bulgaria-the-preview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mxlarge.com/news/6368-grand-prix-of-bulgaria-the-preview&lt;/a&gt;  \nwww.mx-live.tv  \n\n\nMX1/MX2 race 1 and 2 from the second round of MX GP in Bulgaria.\nIs 5 Videos. 4 race and 1 Studio video. \n\nThey was aired as the order below.\n\nMX GP of Bulgaria 2012 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ MX2 Race 1\nSize - 800mb\nTime - 59min 50sec\n\nMX GP of Bulgaria 2012 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ MX1 Race 1\nSize - 792mb\nTime - 59min 30sec\n\nMX GP of Bulgaria 2012 - Studio Show Before Race 2\nSize - 372mb\nTime - 27min 48sec\n\nMX GP of Bulgaria 2012 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ MX2 Race 1\nSize - 793mb\nTime - 59min 44sec\n\nMX GP of Bulgaria 2012 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ MX1 Race 2\nSize - 792mb\nTime - 59min 29sec\n\nVideo\nFormat : MPEG-4\nBit rate : 1 846 Kbps\nWidth :  640 pixels\nHeight : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nAudio\nFormat : AAC\nBit rate : 84.3 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSimpling rate : 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55622296fe0c0bf68afc1da6e8e7208fe96fbfbc","amp;dn":"2012.FIM.Motocross.Grand.Prix.Rd.2.Bulgaria.Webrip-motoman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55622296fe0c0bf68afc1da6e8e7208fe96fbfbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,98,34,150,254,12,11,246,138,252,29,166,232,231,32,143,233,111,191,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
