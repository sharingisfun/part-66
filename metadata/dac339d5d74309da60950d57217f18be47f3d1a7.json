Even if you log on that way, in WIN7 or VISTA you may NOT really have them.  Run the install program by RIGHT clicking on its icon and chose &quot;RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR&quot; from the drop down menu.\n\nDo not keep records that are to be shared in the same folder as the LogicCoach application itself nor keep them anywhere else within the Programs/Applications folder.\n\nIt is best to create and store your record in your Documents folder.  When you return as a registered user then reopen the same record file.  By default, LogicCoach opens the Documents folder for you when saving records.  Finally, to share this record with your instructor, attach the file to an email message that is addressed to your instructor.\n\nYou MUST keep ALL the items installed in the LogicCoach folder together. Do NOT separate them.\n\n\nIt's just another freakin day in paradise!\n\nYours Truly,\nGpEdIt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dac339d5d74309da60950d57217f18be47f3d1a7","amp;dn":"Logic+Coach+11+%28MAC+%26amp%3B+PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dac339d5d74309da60950d57217f18be47f3d1a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,195,57,213,215,67,9,218,96,149,13,87,33,127,24,190,71,243,209,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
