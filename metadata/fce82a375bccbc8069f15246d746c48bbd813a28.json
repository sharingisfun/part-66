When you play them on a stereo setup,\nyou will only hear white noise, which can damage your\nears and speakers ! On the PC they are playable with all\nregular players (Foobar, VLC, Media Player Classic), but\nof course your PC needs to be connected to 6 speakers ;-)\n\nA lot of listeners to 5.1 surround are sceptical about \nupmixes from stereo. In their opinion only studio made 5.1\nis good. I hope they will think again after listening to\nmy upmixes. Of course I cannot make discrete channels like\nthey can in a studio where they record every instrument on\nseparate tracks, but the sound is excellent, there is a lot\nof separation in the 6 different channels and the soundfield\nis immersive. And FWIW 90% of the retail surround titles are\nupmixes, mostly with only some reverb in the rears.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fce82a375bccbc8069f15246d746c48bbd813a28","amp;dn":"Bronski+Beat+Age+of+Consent+5.1+DTS+upmix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fce82a375bccbc8069f15246d746c48bbd813a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,232,42,55,91,204,188,128,105,241,82,70,215,70,196,139,189,129,58,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
