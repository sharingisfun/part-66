She sets out into the world to discover the meaning behind her bad dreams, but Scarygirl is hardly helpless, as she has a tentacle-powered arsenal up her sleeve. During her adventure, Scarygirl will be aided by her friends and guardians from the graphic novel, Blister the giant octopus and Bunniguru the mystical, kung-fu rabbit. Her friends and an ever-improving arsenal of combat moves will help her face down enemies like the adorably deadly hedgehogs of the Owl Woods, the violent Goat Clan along the Old Man Mountains, Hairclump spiders deep in the Stinky Swamp, and the most enemiest enemies of all - the clueless crossing guards around Bad Town!\n\nFEATURES:\n\n-Amazing Art and Design: Surreal landscape and creatures are beautifully fantastical, created by a critically-acclaimed, award-winning artist and true to the art style that Scarygirl fans have already fallen in love with.\n\n-A Curiously Wonderful Stand-Alone Chapter: The game features a new and exceptional storyline separate from the graphic novel and planned feature film, in which Scarygirl finally meets the mysterious man haunting her dreams.\n\n-New Moves, Weapons &amp; Upgrades: The game's upgrade and combat improvement system allows Scarygirl to grow beyond her basic attacks by purchasing new moves, like the Anaconda Squeeze and Morph Tendrils, or attachments for her tentacle arm, such as the Rage Hook.\n\n-Co-Operative Play: While one player controls Scarygirl, a second can bring Bunniguru's furious &quot;Fists of Blurry&quot; into the fray at any time. This offline feature allows the two characters to perform special moves together to overcome major challenges.\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\n1. Run &quot;Scarygirl Setup.exe&quot; as administrator\n3. Play game.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157fb3150f4f91dcc761900e7727acb6bf91db58","amp;dn":"Scarygirl+%28563mb%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157fb3150f4f91dcc761900e7727acb6bf91db58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,127,179,21,15,79,145,220,199,97,144,14,119,39,172,182,191,145,219,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
