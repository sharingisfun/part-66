The shape is that of the 48 contiguous states, the thickness varies according to the elevation. We use this file to generate jewelry (that we sell on www.printablegeography.com), so by default the dimensions are rather small. If you want to print this on your home 3D printer you will probably have to scale this up. The resolution of the file is pretty detailed (163,634 triangles, 7.8MB).\n\nThis file is generated by using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hole-filled seamless SRTM data V4Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ provided by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).
