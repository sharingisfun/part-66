She's quiet, keeps to herself and doesn't get out much - not because she's not pretty - she's a very cute bubbly blonde - or not interested in a social life. She really is... but Sookie's got a bit of a disability. She can read minds. And that doesn't make her too dateable. And then along comes Bill: he's tall, he's dark and he's handsome - and Sookie can't 'hear' a word he's thinking. He's exactly the type of guy she's been waiting all her life for. But Bill has a disability of his own: he's fussy about his food, he doesn't like suntans and he's never around during the day... Yep, Bill's a vampire. Worse than that, he hangs with a seriously creepy crowd, with a reputation for trouble.And then one of Sookie's colleagues at the bar is killed and it's beginning to look like Sookie might be the next victim...\n\nLiving Dead In Dallas \n     by Charlaine Harris \n\nCategory : Fantasy Fiction \nSeries : Sookie Stackhouse Series - Book II\nPublication : 1 March, 2002 \nSynopsis: Cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse is having a streak of bad luck. First her co-worker is killed and no one seems to care. Then she comes face-to-face with a beastly creature which gives her a painful and poisonous lashing. Enter the vampires, who graciously suck the poison from her veins (like they didn't enjoy it).The point is: they saved her life. So when one of the bloodsuckers asks for a favour, she obliges - and soon Sookie's in Dallas, using her telepathic skills to search for a missing vampire. She's supposed to interview certain humans involved, but she makes one condition: the vampires must promise to behave and let the humans go unharmed.But that's easier said than done and all it takes is one delicious blonde and one small mistake for things to turn deadly...\n\nClub Dead \n     by Charlaine Harris \n\nCategory : Fantasy Fiction \nSeries : Sooke Stackhouse Series - Book III \nPublication : 1 May, 2003 \nSynopsis: There's only one vampire Sookie Stackhouse is involved with - at least voluntarily - and that's Bill. But recently he's been a little distant - in another state distant. His sinister and sexy boss Eric has an idea where to find him, and next thing Sookie knows she's off to Jackson, Mississippi, to mingle with the underworld at Club Dead. It's a dangerous little haunt where the elusive vampire society can go to chill out and suck down some Type O - but when Sookie finally finds Bill caught in an act of serious betrayal she's not sure whether to save him, or to sharpen some stakes. The Sookie Stackhouse books are delightful Southern Gothic supernatural mysteries, starring Sookie, the telepathic cocktail waitress, and a cast of increasingly colourful characters, including vampires, werewolves and things that really do go bump in the night.\n\nDead To The World \n     by Charlaine Harris \n\nCategory : Fantasy Fiction \nSeries : Sookie Stackhouse Series IV \nPublication : 4 May, 2004 \nSynopsis: Sookie comes to the rescue of a naked, amnesiac vampire - and ends up in the middle of a war between witches, werewolves and vampires! Sookie Stackhouse is a small-town cocktail waitress in small-town Louisiana. She's pretty. She does her job well. She keeps to herself - she has only a few close friends, because not everyone appreciates Sookie's gift: she can read minds. That's not exactly every man's idea of date bait - unless they're undead - vampires and the like can be tough to read. And that's just the kind of guy Sookie's been looking for. Maybe that's why, when she comes across a naked vampire on the way home from work, she doesn't just drive on by. He hasn't got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy - and dead - as the day she met him. But now he has amnesia, he's sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie's help - because whoever took his memory now wants his life. Sookie's investigation into what's going on leads her straight into a dangerous battle between witches, vampires and werewolves. But there could be even greater danger - to Sookie's heart, because the kinder, gentler Eric is very hard to resist. The Sookie Stackhouse books are delightful Southern Gothic supernatural mysteries, starring Sookie, the telepathic cocktail waitress, and a cast of increasingly colourful characters, including vampires, werewolves and things that really do go bump in the night.\n\nDead As A Doornail \n     by Charlaine Harris \n\nCategory : Fantasy Fiction \nSeries : Sookie Stackhouse Series V \nPublication : 3 May, 2005 \nSynopsis: Sookie Stackhouse enjoys her life, mostly.

Now her brother Jason's eyes are starting to change: he's about to turn into a were-panther for the first time. She can deal with that, but her normal sisterly concern turns to cold fear when a sniper sets his deadly sights on the local changeling population.

Sophie-Anne's power base has been severely weakened by Hurricane Katrina and she's about to be put on trial during the event for murdering her king.Sookie knows the queen is innocent, but she's hardly prepared for other shocking murders: it looks like there are some vamps who would like to finish what nature started.\n\nFrom Dead To Worse \n     by Charlaine Harris \n\nCategory : Fantasy Fiction \nSeries : Sookie Stackhouse Series VIII\nPublication : 6 May, 2008 \nSynopsis: The supernatural community in Bon Temps, Louisiana is reeling from two hard blows: the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade horror of the explosion at the vampire summit in the up-north city of Rhodes.

Though Sookie never cared that much for the victim, no one deserves such a horrible death, so she agrees to use her telepathic talent to track down the murderer.But what Sookie doesn't realise is that there is a far greater danger than this killer threatening Bon Temps: a race of unhuman beings, older, more powerful and far more secretive than the vampires or the werewolves is preparing for war...\n\nDead In The Family \n     by Charlaine Harris \n\nCategory : Fantasy Fiction \nSeries : Sookie Stackhouse Series X\nPublication : 4 May, 2010 \nSynopsis: If you think your family relationships are complicated, think again: you haven't seen anything like the ones in Bon Temps, Louisiana.

And Sookie's tracking down a distant relation of her ailing neighbour (and ex), Vampire Bill Compton. In addition to the multitude of family issues complicating her life, the werewolf pack of Shreveport has asked Sookie for a special favour, and since Sookie is an obliging young woman, she agrees.
