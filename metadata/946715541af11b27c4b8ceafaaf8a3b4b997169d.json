Chul-Min enters his apartment holding a bouquet of flowers for his wife when he sees police officers scattered about collecting evidence. Chul-Min walks into his bedroom and sees a large pool of blood on the bed. The blood is fresh enough that it is still dripping onto the floor. A police officer handcuffs Chul-Min and takes him to the police station.\n\nJang Ho-Won (Sung Dong-Il), a broker for attorneys, brings the case of Han Chul-Min to attorney Kang Sung-Hee (Ha Jung-Woo). He informs the attorney that the alleged murder victim's body was never discovered, the police have yet to find any direct evidence connecting Chul-Min to the murder of his wife and his arrest is all based on circumstantial evidence. Kang Sun-Hee takes the case and applies in court for a jury trial.\n\nProsecutor Ahn Min-Ho (Park Hee-Soon) takes charge of the Han Chul-Min murder case. He has little doubt in the guilt of Chul-Min. Confirming his suspicions he discovers that Han Chul-Min was arrested as the prime suspect in a serial murder case, but later released on insufficient evidence.\n\nIs Han Chul-Min a cold blooded killer or the victim of a coverup? Prosecutor Ahn Min-Ho and Attorney Jang Ho-Won step into court with the fate of Han Chul-Min hanging in the balance. \n\nCast: Jung-woo Ha, Hee-soon Park, Hyuk Jang, Dong-il Song","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:946715541af11b27c4b8ceafaaf8a3b4b997169d","amp;dn":"Uiroein+-+The+Client+%2A2011%2A+%5BDVDRip.XviD-CoWRY%5D+%5BSUB+PL%2FENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"946715541af11b27c4b8ceafaaf8a3b4b997169d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,103,21,84,26,241,27,39,196,184,206,175,170,248,163,180,185,151,22,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
