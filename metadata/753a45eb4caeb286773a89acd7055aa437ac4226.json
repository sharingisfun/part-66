High Voltage the most important thing to mention is Tyler Spencer's solo project. Going under the name of The Dirty Shame, the album Smog Cutter Love Story contained eleven tracks, including Vengeance and Fashion, which would be later re-recorded by Electric Six for their debut mainstream album.\n\nRecorded in 2000 and released in 2001, all the tracks were written by Spencer and he also performed all vocals and instruments, aside from a guitar solo and percussion on Who's Gonna Suffer All Your Industrial Accidents? by Chris Peters (who would later become a permanent member of Electric Six), whose brother Drew played accordion on the same track, as well as Chinese Restaurant.\n\nAs with their second Electric Six album Senor Smoke, the album was recorded at 40oz Studio at Ann Arbor in Michigan by Drew Peters, who mixed the album as well.\n\nThe reason for this release is most commonly cited as the reluctance of the other band members to include these songs in The Wildbunch canon. Therefore Spencer went away and recorded them in this &quot;solo&quot; album.&quot;\n\n\n\nI looked literally EVERYWHERE on the net to find this album and the only place it could still be found was on a random Russian site. I would have preferred 320kbps or lossless files, but this was the best quality I could find them in. I am uploading it here as a torrent to preserve the files and to ensure other people can have access to them. I have very little bandwidth and my upload speed is minimal and so it would be awesome if someone could help me seed it.\n\n\nEnjoy, and remember, seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:753a45eb4caeb286773a89acd7055aa437ac4226","amp;dn":"The+Dirty+Shame+-+Smog+Cutter+Love+Story%28256kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"753a45eb4caeb286773a89acd7055aa437ac4226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,58,69,235,76,174,178,134,119,58,137,172,215,5,90,164,55,172,66,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
