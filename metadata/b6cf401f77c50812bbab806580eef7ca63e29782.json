Pushed by his controlling and ambitious mother Volumnia to seek the exalted and powerful position of Consul, he is loath to ingratiate himself with the masses whose votes he needs in order to secure the office. When the public refuses to support him, Coriolanus's anger prompts a riot that culminates in his expulsion from Rome. The banished hero then allies himself with his sworn enemy Tullus Aufidius to take his revenge on the city.\n\n\n\nTitle ______________ Coriolanus\nSource _____________ Blu-ray\nRelease ____________ 05-10-2012\nRipper _____________ Zoo\nRuntime ____________ 02:03:19\nVideo ______________ x264 @ 2,221 Kbps\nAudio ______________ AC3 6CH @ 448 Kbps\nResolution _________ 1280 x 544\nGenre ______________ Drama | Thriller\nLanguage ___________ English\nSubtitle ___________ English | Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6cf401f77c50812bbab806580eef7ca63e29782","amp;dn":"Coriolanus+2011+720p+BDRip+x264+AC3-Zoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6cf401f77c50812bbab806580eef7ca63e29782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,207,64,31,119,197,8,18,187,171,128,101,128,238,247,202,99,226,151,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
