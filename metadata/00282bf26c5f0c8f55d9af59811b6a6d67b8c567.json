Even though this is an amateur recording of  non-professional singers/worshipers, the sound is clear and harmonious; the words are clearly understood.  The language is mostly English.  The folder includes two video mpg files with the words shown so that the viewer can sing alongÃ¢â‚¬â€suitable for making a DVD.  The m4b file is in 128 k audiobook format suitable for i-phone, i-pad, or computer, where you can move from song to song just as you would change chapters in an audiobook.  There is also a document with all the words to all the songs so you can follow along if your are listening to the m4b version.  You can download ony one of these files or all of them, as you wish.
