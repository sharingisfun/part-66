If the first son of God could turn water into wine, Arthur the self-proclaimed second son can make stony hearts beat again. This is an inspired film. A story of psychiatric patients in a boarding house that doesn't fit into a suburb with pretensions, sounds unpromising but magically they are revealed as very real people by an excellent script and stunning performances from all the leads which draw one in. To say it is moving, witty, and very funny doesn't do it justice. That it took eight years to produce, and after funding was withdrawn was produced on a very low budget may in hindsight have helped. One senses that it is the work of people who believed in it passionately, and put their hearts and genius into it. It shows. (xpc-795-362295 from New Zealand)\n\n\nIncredible as it may seem, funding from the very people who should have been supporting this brilliant New Zealand film (from a book by established, best-selling author, Mike Riddell), was not forthcoming but the production team fought for it and their faith has been amply rewarded.\nThey may not want to thumb their noses at the short-sighted New Zealand Film Commission who ignored them but I'm quite happy to do so ! The Insatiable Moon is an award winner and you missed being part of it. Shame on you.\nBut if there is a message in this movie it is just that - we don't see the value, the insight and beauty of people who have been labelled mentally ill. We don't see them as people at all but as a problem, preferably ignored, certainly underfunded, usually scorned.\nArthur is convinced he's the second son of God and during the course of the movie, the audience moves from the easy, dismissive laughter at such a claim, to the idea that he just might be right.\nAlthough a New Zealand film - and one of an increasing number of top quality productions from this country - the story will resonate in any society.\nIn every community there are those whose inability to cope with lifes's mental strains has relegated them to the background, even the scrapheap. But this movie shows that if we have the courage to think outside the square, with insight and perception, we will surely hear and see great truths.\nA moving, beautiful, happy film with a message for everyone. Don't be like the New Zealand Film Commission and turn your back on something potentially wonderful. The forgotten people are forgotten no more thanks to The Insatiable Moon. Bravo. \n(largelyhappy from New Zealand)\n\n\nThere seemed a very good atmosphere in the audience at the Cineworld, Haymarket, London, especially as we were treated to an intro talk on the THE INSATIABLE MOON by first-time film Director Rosemary Riddell. Also in the audience were the Deputy New Zealand High Commissioner and Lord Justice Thorpe.\nTHE INSATIABLE MOON took almost ten years in the making is set in New Zealand and tells the tale of a bunch of mentally impaired misfits that dwell in a boarding house within the local community of Ponsonby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ much like an &quot;extended family of outcasts&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ much to the dismay of many of the residents.\nThere are activists within the community that would like to close the commune down, sell the property and move the residents away from their town.\nThe main-stay of the commune is the very down to earth &quot;street-talking&quot; Bob Davis (played admirably by Greg Johnson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who likes to &quot;tell it like it is&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and against all trials and tribulations, it is his efforts that keep the &quot;family&quot; together.\nThere are a bunch of weird characters within the commune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the most notable being Arthur (play superbly by Maori actor Rawiri Paratene ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who had a starring role in the Oscar nominated Whale Rider). Arthur truly believes that he is the second son of God and his charisma is such, that it tends to convince some of those he meets that there may be something in his claims.\nA side story to the plot concerns the kind hearted Margaret (Sara Wiseman) who is having emotional issues in her marriage in her overwhelming desire to cope with getting pregnant in a loveless marriage, who falls for the &quot;purity&quot; of Arthur's crusade to save the boarding house from being taken over ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and she eventually falls for Arthur ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nThere are some good comic moments and some very sad moments due to the subject matter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ but, putting these moments aside, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ this is at it's heart a story about community bonding and stresses that however &quot;outcast&quot; you may be you can still find a &quot;family&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a &quot;home&quot; where you can be welcomed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and that together you are stronger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ than if you are alone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nAfter the presentation we were invited to stay after the film for a Q&amp;A session with two of the film's producers (one who was Mike Riddell the Directors husband and Scriptwriter for the movie), the director and Rawiri Paratene ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who played the lead role of Arthur in the movie.\nAfter which several of the New Zealanders in the audience gave a very welcomed impromptu sing-along / chants / dance session in tribute to the film and for what it stands for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ it was a good night ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nTaglines: Sometimes you have to let go and see where you end up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nIn a mad world, only the mad are saneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nI would say that THE INSATIABLE MOON would not cater to all tastes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and it would possibly help it you had an interest in New Zealand and the Maori culture ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ but those who do see it may have their eyes opened to another way of thinking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ which can only be a good thing for all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nTHE INSATIABLE MOON is 100mins long, is possibly more suited to adults because of the subject matter and will be on general release from 7th October, 2010 \n(colin_coyne from London)\n..................................................................................\n\n\nSPECS: \n\nFile Name .........................................: The_Insatiable_Moon.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,468,499,968 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:37:10\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x400 (AR: 1.800)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1560 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.217 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n..................................................................................\n\n\nInterview with Mike Riddell (Producer/Story/Script) included.\n\n\nIn New Zealand beginning in the late '70's/early '80's it became the\ncustom to release mental patients from closed institutions into so-called\n&quot;half-way houses&quot; usually located in the cities. That way, it was felt,\nthe mentally-ill could be de-institutionalized and perhaps re-integrated\ninto the wider community. Co-incidentally, it was also a whole lot cheaper,\nbecause expensive state-funded mental hospitals could be downsize, and in \nsome cases close their doors for good.\n\nAt the same time the &quot;gentrification&quot; of certain formerly working-class suburbs\nwas proceeding, as the newly-rich sought to expand their turf. Unsuitable\nworking-class owners of broken-down residential properties were bought out \n(Zit! you're gone!) and property prices rose.\n\nThe contrary movement of the ill and unstable to &quot;half-way houses&quot; (usually\nold-established boarding-houses) was strongly opposed by the new middle-class\ngentry. They didn't want their property values to decline as a result of the\nweirdo invasions.\n\nThis is the background to the movie. It didn't do very well on initial release,\ncertainly not in the gentrified suburbs like Ponsonby. It just faded away \nwith the morning dew, but in the opinion of many --- see the IMDB comments \n(not one negative comment) -- it is a very fine film.\n\n...............................................................................\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art \nin the digital era.
