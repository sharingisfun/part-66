It sets out to paint a portrait of a whole society, telling the stories of a wide range of characters, both real and imagined, from every social level. Their narratives are developed and gradually interwoven over the first three episodes, each of which ends in a cliffhanger as the ship begins to founder. The fourth and final episode draws all of the different stories together and reveal to the audience who survives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29c7feb9d4e795bac92fb29f1aa9a38ba96c7cca","amp;dn":"Titanic.SWESUB.S01E01.WEBRiP.XviD-snuttebullen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29c7feb9d4e795bac92fb29f1aa9a38ba96c7cca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,199,254,185,212,231,149,186,201,47,178,159,26,169,163,139,169,108,124,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
